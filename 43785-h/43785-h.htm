<p class="h1">RUTH ERSKINE&#39;S SON</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h3">WHIMS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">As</span> a matter of fact the name of this story
should be: Ruth Erskine Burnham&#39;s
Son. But there are those living who remember
Ruth Erskine and her memorable summer
at the New York Chautauqua; and that
name is so entirely associated with those four
girls at Chautauqua, and their after experiences,
that it seems natural to speak of her boy,
Erskine, as Ruth Erskine&#39;s son; although, of
course, he was also Judge Burnham&#39;s son.</p>

<p class="indent">The day on which she is again introduced to
her friends was a dull one in late autumn;
the afterglow of sunset was already fading, and
the shadows were gathering fast. It was the
hour that Erskine Burnham liked best for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
piano. He was at that moment softly touching
the keys, bringing forth harmonious sounds
with the air of one not even hearing them.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a handsome boy. The promise of
his early life,&mdash;during which time the exclamation,
&quot;What a beautiful child!&quot; was being
continually heard,&mdash;was being fulfilled in his
boyhood. Friends of his father were fond of
assuring Ruth that the boy was his father&#39;s
image; while her friends were sure that no boy
could be more like his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Ruth when she saw her son bending
over his books, a lock of hair continually dropping
over his left eye and being continually
flung back with a gesture peculiar to Judge
Erskine, she would say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is very much like his grandfather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the boy grew older he laughed at all these
opinions, and asked his mother if she did not
think it would be difficult for a fellow to have
any individuality who was strikingly like three
people who were all, as nearly as he could make
out, strikingly unlike one another.</p>

<p class="indent">This remark was one of the memories that
came back to her as she looked out at the swift-falling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
night, and listened to that musical
strain which was being played over and over and
<i>over</i>. She seemed to be watching the people
who were hurrying homeward, glancing apprehensively
now and then at the sky; for despite
the glow of sunset there were premonitions of a
coming storm, and already a few advance
snowflakes were beginning to fall. But Mrs.
Burnham saw neither people nor snowflakes;
or rather she saw them without seeing. Her
eyes were swimming in tears that she did not
intend to let have their way. Not as girl or
woman had Ruth Erskine Burnham been given
to tears, although there had been reason enough
in her life for them. Since she had not indulged
them then, she did not mean to begin now that
she was middle-aged and her hair was being
sprinkled with gray.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been going over the story of the years
with herself, that afternoon, which might
account in part for the dimmed eyes. It seemed
to her, looking back, that her chief mission in
life had been to minister at dying beds and follow
as chief or almost chief mourner in funeral
processions. She had gone away back to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
betrothed of her youth, and added one more
heavy sigh to the multitude that stood for a
lost opportunity. How entirely Harold Wayne
had been under her influence! how utterly
she had failed him! And she had felt it only
when she was following him to the grave. Then
those other graves, her father&#39;s and Judge
Burnham&#39;s daughters&#39;, Seraph and Minta, what
strange sad memories she had connected with
both those graves that were not a year apart in
their making. And then their father had been
laid beside them and they two were left alone in
the world, she and Erskine.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not yet eighteen, but there were times
when it seemed to his mother that he was much
older, and that he and she had been alone
together always. All these memories that,
because it was an anniversary of one of her
bereavements, had been more vivid with her
than usual that day, trooped again about her
as she stood in the waning light, apparently
intent on watching the outside world, in order
to escape being watched by her world, inside.</p>

<p class="indent">To people who were acquainted with the girl,
Ruth Erskine, it will not seem strange that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
look backward over her checkered life brought
sombre thoughts that were close to tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the four girls who, years and years before
when they were young and full of courage,
went to Chautauqua together and lived their
eventful summer and began their new lives
together, hers had had the strangest, saddest
story; it had been marked by experiences
so unlike the commonplace that the world had
stopped to look, and express its astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">The unusual began with her father&#39;s strange
revelations about that new mother who yet was
not new, but had been her stepmother for years.
Was ever daughter before called upon to receive
a new mother in such way as that? But
why go over all that ground again? She too
had been followed to the grave, and no one of
all Mrs. Burnham&#39;s friends had been more
sincerely missed and mourned. Then there was
her sister, Susan Erskine. Was ever heavier
cross or greater blessing thrust into a life than
that girl represented to the girl Ruth Erskine?
It had been one of her later trials to give Susan
up to China. She was sorely missed, but it
had been good for Erskine to have such a missionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
Auntie as she made. And those two
strange girls Seraphina and Araminta Burnham.
Could some writer put into print the story of
those two lives as it interlaced with hers, the
foolish world would call it fiction, and criticise
it as unnatural.</p>

<p class="indent">Over the early days of her widowhood Ruth
Burnham knew better than to linger. Though
so many years had intervened that the little
boy he left had grown to young manhood, she
still missed his father so sorely that she could
not trust herself to stay among those few
precious months before he went suddenly from
her.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been left, without even the warning
of an hour, to bring up their boy alone! It
was from this form of her bereavement that
she had shrunken back most fearfully. Judge
Burnham, with his life consecrated to God, had
seemed eminently fitted to guide the life of just
such a boy as theirs; but God had planned
differently.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, what people call the anxious
years were gone, and she had kept her boy.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the tears which she did not mean to shed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
were, in part, for him. She knew better than
most mothers seem to understand that there
were still &quot;anxious years&quot; to be lived through.</p>

<p class="indent">They had lingered over the breakfast table
that morning, discussing certain questions that
had been discussed before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma,&quot; the boy had said as he served her
to fruit, &quot;how came you to have pronounced
ideas about all sorts of things? Were you
always so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother laughed genially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a definite question for a lawyer to
ask!&quot; for Erskine had already announced his
intention of being a lawyer like his father and
grandfather.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What &#39;things&#39; are supposed to be under
consideration?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He echoed her laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinking aloud then,&quot; he said. &quot;It
often seems to me as though you and I knew
each other&#39;s thoughts. But just now I am
thinking of one of our argumentative subjects.
In spite of the horror in which you have brought
me up of those bits of pasteboard called cards,
I find that I cannot feel precisely as you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
like to have me, concerning them. I used to.
As a child nobody could be fiercer than I in
their denunciation; but I find that that was
merely a reflex influence, and not judgment.
In spite of me nowadays they look meek and
harmless; and I was wondering how you and
they came to be in such fierce antagonism.
Was my father of that mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I fierce, Erskine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He gave her a half-quizzical, wholly loving
smile as he said gayly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That of course is not the word to apply to
the most charming of women, but you know,
dearest, that you are very much in earnest about
all such matters. Were you brought up in that
way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, when I was of your age, and younger,
we played cards at home; and I went to card-parties
in our set very often. It was your
Aunt Flossy who set a number of us to thinking
and studying and praying about such matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine shook his head with pretended
gravity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might have known it, mamma. Aunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
Flossy isn&#39;t like people; in fact she always
seems to me a trifle out of place on earth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you were very fond indeed of your
Aunt Flossy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I am; and I think I should be very fond
of an angel from heaven; but you see, when
a fellow has to live on the earth, it is a trifle
more convenient to be like the other earth worms.
All of which was suggested by the fact that the
Mitchells are to give a card-party next week.
Very select, you understand, only the choice
few are bidden and I happen to be one of
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, although his mother shrank from it,
feeling that it did harm rather than good to go
again over ground that was familiar to both
and that was so clear to her and did not convince
her son, he persisted in arguing, and in trying
to prove that her position was narrow and
untenable in these days. Throughout the
interview he had been courteous and winsome, as
he always was with her, and had laughingly
complimented her more than once on her skill
in argument; but for all that, she knew he was
entirely unconvinced, and felt that her hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
on him was weaker than when they had gone
over the same ground before. The fact was,
and this mother knew it well, that the world and
all the allurements for which that phrase stands
was making a hard fight for her handsome son
even so early in life, and there were times when
she felt fearful that in a sense it would win.
It was not that she believed he would ever be
sorely tempted by any of the amusements
or frivolities of life; he was strong-principled
and strong-willed, and certain, that might be
called main, points had been settled by him
once for all. Yet none knew better than did this
woman of long and peculiar experience that it
was possible to maintain a high standing in the
world and in the church and yet have almost
as little knowledge of that life hid with Christ
in God which was the Christian&#39;s rightful
heritage as did the gay world around him. She
craved this separated life for Erskine, yet he
was social in his tastes and fond of being looked
upon as a leader, and his mother knew it already
irked him to feel that in certain social functions
he must always be counted out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are so many of them!&quot; he had said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
to her once, with as much impatience in his
tone as he ever gave to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A fellow could manage to indulge one or
two whims, but you know, dearest, you have
at least half a dozen, and to humor them all
will make a rather conspicuous wallflower, I
am afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something very like that he had repeated that
morning, and it had colored his mother&#39;s day.
She knew that the Mitchells were fond of
Erskine and would make vigorous efforts to
secure him for their party. It was hard, she
told herself, that one so fitted to shine in cultured
circles of young people must so often be
made to feel embarrassed and out of place, and
she wondered for the dozenth time that season
if ways of thinking about these things had
changed, along with other changes. Was she
herself what Erskine, if he had made use of the
modern slang, might call a &quot;back number&quot;?
&quot;Still, his father, who had no such prejudices
as mine to deal with, grew very positive in his
objection to cards,&quot; she reminded herself, and
sighed. If his father had lived, he would have
known just how to manage Erskine; this, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
least, she pleased herself by believing, ignoring
the fact that in their son&#39;s early boyhood the
father had had many ways of managing, of
which she did not approve. This is a habit
which we all have with our beloved dead.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the memory of their morning talk
that had led Mrs. Burnham to appeal, that
afternoon, to Mr. Conway when he dropped in
for a social chat. Mr. Conway was their new
pastor; a brilliant, scholarly man, much admired
by old and young. Erskine in particular had
been attracted to him, and was decidedly of
the opinion that in the pulpit he was a great
improvement on Dr. Dennis, even. Of course
his mother did not agree with this verdict,
but she was wise enough to remember that the
friends of her girlhood could not be expected to
be to her son what they were to her. Yet
Erskine was eminently fair and thoughtful
beyond his years for her. At the very time when
he had so heartily indorsed Mr. Conway, he had
made haste to say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, mamma, there is a sense in which
no one can ever equal Dr. Dennis to us, and as
for Aunt Marian her loss is irreparable.&quot; He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
held carefully to the boyish custom of claiming
his mother&#39;s girl friends as aunts, and she liked
it in him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; he had added firmly, &quot;as
a preacher Mr. Conway is far superior to Dr.
Dennis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Despite his careful courtesy Erskine was at
the age when wisdom is at its height, and opinions
as a rule are delivered autocratically without
any softening &quot;I think.&quot; His mother,
having often to make objections from principle,
had learned the art of being silent when she
could, and she had made no objection in words
to his estimate of Mr. Conway. To a degree
she was in sympathy with it. She liked Mr.
Conway and was glad that he was so young that
Erskine, being old for his years, could find him
almost companionable, and at the same time
could be helped by him.</p>

<p class="indent">Because of all these reasons she had been
glad that Erskine was in, that afternoon when
Mr. Conway called. He was fond of calling there,
and playfully accused the two of being responsible
for many neglected families in his parish.
She had kept herself almost quiet while Erskine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
and their guest discussed books and music and
men. They had many tastes in common. Then
Erskine had been urged to play, and his selection
from one of the great masters had chanced to be
Mr. Conway&#39;s special favorite; and then, Mrs.
Erskine having studied how to do it in an unstudied
way, had skilfully turned the conversation
into the channel of her morning talk
with Erskine; and before two minutes had passed
would have given much to be able to take back
what she had done.</p>

<h2><a name="chII" id="chII"></a>
CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h3">&quot;NEVER MIND, MOMMIE&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Yet</span> in thinking it over, this course had
seemed to Mrs. Burnham eminently wise.
Mr. Conway was quite as much in touch with
the fashionable world as a clergyman could well
be; he had been brought up in its atmosphere
and had turned from what were supposed to be
very alluring prospects to live the comparatively
straitened life of a minister of the gospel. His
undoubted scholarship commended him especially
to a young fellow like Erskine who came
of a scholarly line. If, without being directly
appealed to for advice, the minister could be
drawn into an expression of opinion about these
questionable matters, it would certainly help;
and under her skilful management he expressed
himself; but behold, he was on the wrong side!
At least he was not on the side that Ruth
Burnham, having been for years accustomed to
the pastorate of Dr. Dennis, had taken it for
granted that he would be.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
There was, he assured her, something to be
said on the other side of that question. Of
course he was opposed to all forms of gambling,
but a social game of cards in the parlor of a friend
was innocent amusement enough&mdash;much better
than certain others he could name that seemed
to have escaped the ban of the over-cautious.
He was really in earnest about this matter.
He considered that there was positive danger in
drawing the lines too taut. He knew a fellow
in college who had been very carefully reared
in one of those very narrow homes where a card
was never allowed to penetrate, and where
they looked in holy horror upon the idea of his
touching one elsewhere; but he hadn&#39;t been in
college an entire year before he spent half his
nights at cards! and he went to the bad as fast
as he could. That, the clergyman believed,
was what often happened when young people
were held too closely. That was by no means
the only instance which had come under his
personal knowledge, and indeed he believed that,
of the two extremes, he feared the narrow the
more. Human nature was such that there was
sure to be a rebound from over-strictness, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
the clearer, keener brained the victim was, the
more fear of results. There was much more
of the same sort. Poor Ruth, who had not
meant to argue, and who had wished of all things
to avoid anything that would look in the least
like a personal matter, tried in vain to change
the subject. Erskine, with an occasional mischievous
glance for her alone, led his pastor
on to say much more than he had probably
intended at first. Not that he differed from
him in the least; on the contrary he took the
rôle of an eager youth to whom it was a vital
matter to have the &quot;narrowness&quot; of his surroundings
immediately widened.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham, disappointed and hurt, became
almost entirely silent, and when she finally
walked down the hall with her departing pastor,
felt no wish to consult him about a matter on
which she had intended to ask his advice at
the first opportunity. She had a feeling that
it made little difference to her what his advice
was on any subject; yet she knew that that was
real narrowness and that she must rise above it.
Such was the condition of things on that evening
in late autumn when she stood looking out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
bay window at the swiftly gathering night and
appeared to be watching the passers-by through
a mist of unshed tears, while Erskine played
exquisite strains of harmony. His mother,
listening, or rather letting the music melt
unconsciously into her being, felt peculiarly
alone with her responsibilities. Who was she
that she should hope, alone and unaided, to battle
successfully with the temptations of this great
wicked world full of yawning pitfalls especially
prepared for the feet of young men? How
was she ever to hope to guide a boy like Erskine
successfully through its snares, without even a
pastor to lean upon? What if Erskine should
be like that college boy Mr. Conway had taken
such pains to describe graphically and insist
upon going to the bad as soon as he was away
from her influence? She could see that that
was just what was being feared for him; it
was probably what Mr. Conway meant.</p>

<p class="indent">Wait, must her boy, her one treasure, be away
from her influence? Yes, of course he must;
everybody said so. Why, there were people
who were certain that she was ruining her
son by keeping so close to him even now. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
only now, but away back in his young boyhood.
She recalled with a shiver of pain how her husband
had once said to her:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a care, Ruth; you don&#39;t want to
make a Molly Coddle of the boy, remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Later, she had heard of one of the Mitchells
as declaring that &quot;Mrs. Burnham was making
a regular &#39;Miss Nancy&#39; of that boy of hers,
and if somebody did not take him in hand, he
would be ruined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, her intimate friends had been as plain
with their cautions as they dared. Had not
Marian Dennis pleaded earnestly for a famous
boys&#39; school fifty miles away? &quot;It would
be so good for him, Ruth; he would learn self-reliance
and patience; two lessons that a boy
never can learn at home, when there is but one.&quot;
And Dr. Dennis had added his word: &quot;As
a rule, my friend, a boy learns manliness by
being compelled to be manly and to depend upon
himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was her old friend Eurie, with four
rollicking, romping boys of her own, always
looking doubtfully at Ruth&#39;s fair-haired, fair-skinned,
rather quiet, always gentlemanly boy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
&quot;Let him come and spend a summer with us,
Ruth,&quot; she urged, &quot;and row and swim and
hunt and get almost shot and quite drowned a
few times; it will do him good, body and soul.
Boys learn manhood by hairbreadth escapes,
you know.&quot; She had laughed at Ruth&#39;s shudder
and had told Marian privately that &quot;Ruth was
simply idiotic over that poor boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Only Flossy, their dainty, gentle, still beautiful
Flossy, had seemed to understand. Had she
too meant a caution? As she kissed Ruth good-by,
the four girls of Chautauqua memory having
spent a never-to-be-forgotten week together at
Ruth Burnham&#39;s home, she had said gently:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The best place in the world for a boy, dear
Ruth, is as close to his mother as he wants to
be, just as long as he plans to be there. I
have studied boys a good deal, and I think I am
sure of so much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth&#39;s face had flushed over this murmured
word. She had been half vexed with the others,
but it had been given to their little Flossy, as
often before, to give her a new thought. She
studied over it; she took it to heart and let it
color all her movements. More and more after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
that, although Erskine was still quite young,
she kept herself in the background and pushed
him forward. On their little trips to the larger
city and in any of their outings indeed, she compelled
herself to sit quietly in the waiting-room,
while Erskine went to buy tickets and check
baggage. It is true that every nerve in her body
quivered with apprehension until he was safely
beside her again, yet she held firmly to her
purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Very early in their life alone together she
ceased any attempt to drive the ponies that were
Erskine&#39;s delight, and sat beside him outwardly
quiet and inwardly quaking until she had learned
her lesson&mdash;reminding herself continually that
the boy&#39;s father had taught him to love and to
manage horses when he was too small to touch
his feet to the carriage floor.</p>

<p class="indent">She gave up early, and with a purpose, the
taking Erskine to town with her for a round of
shopping or pleasure-seeking, and learned to
say meekly and in a natural tone of voice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you take me to town on Saturday, dear?
I have many errands to do, and I don&#39;t like to
go alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
She had lived through all these things, and it
was not in any such directions that either she
or her friends had fears any more. Erskine
was self-reliant enough; in fact he was masterful,
though so courteous in his ways that few beside
herself suspected it. He had inherited much
from his father. Still, the mother knew that
there was a strong sense in which she dominated
his life. That he went to certain places and
refrained from going to certain others simply
to please her and not at all as a matter of principle.
She was far from being satisfied with
this, and was always asking herself: &quot;How
long will he do this?&quot; and &quot;Are such concessions
worth anything in the way of character?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had many questions, this anxious mother
of one child; there were days, and this was one,
when they pressed her sorely.</p>

<p class="indent">The music flowed on; now soft and tender as a
caress, now breaking into great waves of sound
that meant energy, and possibly conflict.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly it ceased with a great crash of keys,
still in harmony, and the boy wheeled on his
stool, looked at his mother, and laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You woke up the wrong chap that time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
didn&#39;t you, mother?&quot; he said. &quot;It was as
good as a play to hear him go on and to watch
your face. I haven&#39;t enjoyed anything so much
in a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed again over the memory. His
mother did not join in the laugh; just then she
could not. Those tears that she had managed,
not allowing them to fall, had somehow got into
her throat. She felt that she should choke if
she attempted to speak, and she could not summon
at the moment more than the ghost of a
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine wheeled back to the piano for a moment,
played a few bars of a popular song with
one hand, humming it softly; then, in the midst
of a line, arose and strolled over to the window
where his mother stood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, mommie,&quot; he said, bending
his tall form low enough to kiss the tip of one
ear&mdash;a whimsical little caress peculiar to himself.
&quot;She mustn&#39;t go and look at the clouds
and the storm and the dark as though there
wasn&#39;t any sunshine anywhere. I am not intending
to go to the dogs as soon as I go away
from home, merely because my mother did her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
level best all her life to keep me right side up
with care; and in my opinion it would be a poor
sort of chap who would do any such thing.
And I don&#39;t feel the need of a social game of
cards now and then as a safeguard, either.
I don&#39;t feel especially &#39;taut,&#39; mommie, honestly;
and I don&#39;t care a straw for the Mitchells&#39; card
party. Did you really think I cared for it on
that account? How absurd! Don&#39;t you
worry one least little mite, mamma, there is
absolutely nothing to be troubled over except
that you have a pastor who doesn&#39;t know enough
to talk a little bit on the side that you want
talked, or else keep still. Wasn&#39;t it funny?&quot;
He laughed once more, then added, a trifle more
gravely:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When that man is older, he will understand
people better, perhaps. Don&#39;t you hope so?
Shall I read to you, mamma, a little while? I
have a delicious book here that I know you will
enjoy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Did he understand, would he ever understand,
what a mountain weight he had suddenly lifted
from his mother&#39;s heart? What a gracious,
sweet-spirited, self-sacrificing boy he was! Had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
there ever been one just like him? She knew
he was fond of the Mitchells, and that they were
eager to have him with them in their social
life; they had brought as much pressure as they
could, and he had resisted it for his mother&#39;s
sake.</p>

<p class="indent">It was sweet, but&mdash;She could not keep
back one little sigh. She was a devoted mother;
but she would, oh, so much rather it had been
for Christ&#39;s sake.</p>

<p class="indent">There was an unexpected outcome from that
interview with Mr. Conway. In a very short
time it became evident that he had lost his hold
upon Erskine. Not that the boy turned against
him seriously; but he smiled over some of his
words and purposely misquoted others in a
spirit of mischief. Occasionally there was a
curve to the smile that suggested a sneer;
and the strongest feeling he evinced for him
might be called indifference. In his secret
heart Erskine knew that he was being unreasonable,
and was really resenting his mother&#39;s
having been made uncomfortable; but he could
not get away from the feeling that Mr. Conway,
having been weighed in his mother&#39;s balance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
and found wanting, was not to his mind, however
much he himself might differ from her.
Of course all this was mere feeling, not principle.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the clergyman, who prided himself
on his influence with young men and who
puzzled anxiously over Erskine Burnham&#39;s
changed attitude which he vaguely felt and could
not define, might have been helped if some one
had been frank enough to explain the situation.
Nobody did. The boy scoffed in secret, assuring
himself that a minister who could not be a comfort
to a woman and a widow when she tried to
lean on him was a &quot;poor sort of chap.&quot; As for
the mother, she told herself that if she had not
been weak and foolish in carrying her anxieties
to others, Mr. Conway would not have lost his
influence over Erskine; and the minister remained
perplexed and anxious; he was sincerely
eager to be helpful to young men.</p>

<p class="indent">Outwardly they all went on as before. The
Mitchells and others of their kind made their
card parties and their social dances and their
theatre parties and continued to invite eagerly
Mrs. Burnham&#39;s handsome young son, who cheerfully
declined all invitations and stayed with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
mother. But he argued no more; in fact he
declined to do so, setting the whole matter
gayly aside, with a cheerful&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t let us argue about these things any
more, mommie. We shouldn&#39;t agree, and they
are not worth disagreeing over. I don&#39;t care
a copper for the whole crowd of entertainments
that you think of with interrogation points
attached, and I don&#39;t care two straws about what
others think of me in connection with them;
so let us taboo the whole subject and enjoy
ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother would have liked something very
different. She would have been glad if he had
given himself to the study of such matters, and
settled them from principle. She harassed
herself by imagining what an unspeakably
happy mother she would be if instead of his
gay, kind words he had said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been looking into this matter carefully
and I understand why you take the position
that you do. In fact I do not see how a Christian
could do otherwise. I shall take it with
you, and you may consider that the question
is settled with me for all time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
However, it is something, indeed it is a great
deal, for a lone and lonely mother to have a
boy go her way, and go smilingly, merely to
please her.</p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p class="h3">MAMIE PARKER</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> a bright winter day more than a year
after Mr. Conway&#39;s deliverance with regard
to cards, Mrs. Burnham&#39;s next very distinct
milestone was set up. She was away
from the old home and Mr. Conway and all the
associations of her past. She was spending her
second winter in a lively college town, and
Erskine was a sophomore.</p>

<p class="indent">The lonely mother of one son had been through
much anxiety and perplexity before the plans
for this change in their life were fully formed.
Erskine&#39;s gay rendering of the situation was that
not only did every adopted aunt and uncle and
grandmother that he had in the world know
best how to plan their life for them, but had each
a pet college to ride as a hobby. He gave this
as a reason why it was just as well to break all
their hearts at one fell swoop and choose for
himself&mdash;which was what in effect he had done;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
at least he had gone quite contrary to the urgings
of his other friends and had compromised with his
mother. But he had made quite a compromise.
His very first choice had been one of which she
entirely disapproved; nor could she be persuaded
despite his arguments to change her point
of view. In vain he held her quite into the
night in a close and eager debate, setting forth
his important reasons with skill and eloquence.
In vain he assured her that conditions had
very much changed since his father had expressed
disapproval of this particular centre of learning,
and as for his grandfather, why there was
nothing left of his times but the name.</p>

<p class="indent">His mother urged that her opinion, or her feeling&mdash;he
might call it feeling if he chose&mdash;was
not based on his grandfather&#39;s or even entirely
on his father&#39;s views, but was the result of her
own reading and inquiry, and was unalterable.
If he selected that college, it would be in direct
opposition to her strongly expressed wishes.
She had been tempted to add that if he did so,
his money, left in her charge and subject to
her decisions until he was of legal age, would not
be forthcoming. She was mercifully preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
from making this mistake. Had she said so,
he would probably have gone to the college of
his choice even though he had to go penniless.
As it was, his eyes flashed a little. But his
mother&#39;s voice had trembled as she added those
last words, &quot;And I suppose I need not try to
tell you how such a course would hurt
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was that which held the boy. He sprang
up suddenly, took two or three hasty turns up
and down the room in a manner so like his
father&#39;s that Ruth could hardly bear it, then
his face had cleared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall not be hurt, mommie,&quot; he had
said in his usual cheery tone. &quot;You shall
never be hurt by me. I want that college
more I presume than I could make you understand,
and the more I think about it the more
I feel that I should like to choose it. But I
am not a baby who must have everything he
wants; and I do not care enough for anything
on earth to get it at the expense of hurting you.
You know that, don&#39;t you? I&#39;ll tell you,
mother, we will compromise; this is an age
of compromise. I will drop my first choice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
from this time forth if you will unite heartily
with me on the second one and help me stop this
clamor of tongues.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It had not been by any means her second
choice, but she felt that having been treated
so well she must meet him halfway; so the
vexed question was settled.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been another anxiety. Marion
Dennis had written to her not to make the mistake
of following her boy to college; and Dr.
Dennis had added a few lines to the same effect,
saying that in nine cases out of ten he believed
such a course to be a mistake, and even in
the tenth, separation would probably have been
better. Moreover, an only son and an only
child needed, as a rule, more than any other
to be thrown on his own resources. All the
old arguments over again, and numberless plans
for the disposal of the mother. She was to
come to the Dennis home for a visit of unlimited
length; she was to spend the winter with Flossy;
she was to go abroad with Grace and her husband.
Eurie, the outspoken, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Ruth, don&#39;t, I beg of you, tie that dear
boy to your apron-string. I am the mother of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
five, and I know all about how they talk, and
how they feel when they don&#39;t talk. Besides,
I need you this winter as never before; let me
tell you something.&quot; Then had followed revelations
intended to prove that it was Ruth&#39;s
imperative duty to spend the winter with her
old friend.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Conway added his courteous hint, and
suggested plans. Mrs. Conway wondered if
Mrs. Burnham would not like to join her sister
Helen and their mutual friends, the Hosmers,
on an extended Western trip, now that she was
to be alone. The winter was an ideal time for
such a tour as they had planned; and it would
be pleasant for Erskine to think of his mother
as travelling with friends instead of being at
home alone. Poor Ruth! her heart turned
from them all in almost rebellion. If she
must be separated from Erskine for the first
time in his life, couldn&#39;t she be let alone in her
own home? To go visiting or sight-seeing
without him she felt would be unbearable. She
kept most of these anxieties and advices to herself,
feeling that she must not cloud Erskine&#39;s
last days at home with them. Still, she wondered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
not a little,&mdash;and sometimes it hurt her,&mdash;that
he had not spoken of her plans at all, but
seemed to be so absorbed in his own as to have
forgotten her. At last, when she felt that some
positive decision must be reached, she told him
of Mr. Conway&#39;s proposition, and showed him
Eurie&#39;s letter. He glanced it through, smiling
serenely:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aunt Eurie is cool, as usual,&quot; he remarked.
&quot;They can all save their time by planning for
somebody else, can&#39;t they? Of course I am
going to take you with me, mommie. Do they
think I would leave you in this big house alone,
or let you go travelling without me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was all so easy to arrange after that. It
sounded so different from the wording in those
letters when Erskine himself replied to them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very grateful for your thoughtful
kindness about my mother, but I am going to
take her with me; I had not a thought of doing
otherwise. I should not be comfortable to have
her away from my care in winter, even though
she were with you. I have so long made her
first in my thoughts and look upon her so entirely
as my father&#39;s precious charge to me, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
no other plan is to be thought of. I shall find
pleasant rooms for her, and I think she will
enjoy the change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth smiled proudly as she made her verbal
explanations. &quot;Thank you very much, but
Erskine says I am to go with him; he cannot
think of trusting me to myself; he has taken
care of me for a long time, you know.&quot; There
was not a thought of sarcasm in this suggestion.
She knew that the assumption of authority sat
well on her handsome son who could look down
on her from his splendid height; it seemed quite
in keeping with his appearance and character
that he was going to take his mother with him
in order to take care of her.</p>

<p class="indent">The scheme had worked well. He &quot;took&quot;
his mother and took excellent care of her, and
incidentally she did much, of course, for his
comfort, and they were happy. Early in his
college career she had sometimes overheard
explanations like this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, boys, I can&#39;t join you to-night. You
see, I have my mother with me and I feel bound
to give her what time I can spare. It will never
do to have her feel lonely and deserted after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
bringing her away out here among strangers,
on purpose to take care of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was all very pleasant. But she had learned
something from those letters and that volume
of advice. She tried steadily not to dominate
her son; indeed, so far as a carefully-watched-over
mother could, she effaced herself, or tried
to. Erskine had no thought of such a thing, and
was openly and serenely happy in his mother&#39;s
society.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I pity the other fellows,&quot; was a phrase often
on his lips. &quot;Most of them live in pokey rooms
all by themselves or with only each other; no
woman to speak to but a cross-grained hostess,
and nothing homelike anywhere; while here it
is almost as nice as being at home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he would glance complacently around
the handsomely furnished suite of rooms that
showed everywhere the touch of his mother&#39;s
hand. But of course there were evenings that
were not spent with his mother. It was in
connection with one of these that she reached
that distinct milestone of which mention has
been made. Erskine in explaining about it
had shown an unaccountable embarrassment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
&quot;It is just a kind of spread that one of the
boys is getting up in honor of his sister; she
has come to spend the winter with him. It is
rather new business to him and I have promised
to help him through, so I must go early and stay
late&mdash;not very late, though. Parker&#39;s landlady
will look out for that; she is one of the
grim and surly kind. I should have the shivers
if I had to get up a spread, with her in charge.
Yes, Parker is the curly-headed one that you
don&#39;t quite fancy. I don&#39;t know why, he is a
good fellow. Haven&#39;t I spoken before of his
sister? She has been here for three weeks.
Didn&#39;t you notice Parker last Wednesday at the
concert? He sat just across from us and had
her with him. Yes, she is at his boarding-house,
and the spread is in his room. He
has the downstairs room, mother, in fact
it is the back parlor; there is a folding-bed
that does duty as a sort of sideboard during
the day. It is very nice, really. One
wouldn&#39;t imagine that there was a bed anywhere
around. Parker is one of the fellows
who has a good deal of money, I think, but not
the culture that generally goes with such a condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Sometimes I fancy that his father must
have made his money lately and suddenly; but,
of course, I don&#39;t know. Still, everything is
very nice and proper about this spread; of
course you know that, or I wouldn&#39;t be in it.
The sister? Oh, yes, she is young&mdash;younger than
Parker. He is older than most of us, you know.
No, there are no women in the house except the
landlady and her sister, a maiden lady. That&#39;s
a pity; it must be rather lonely for Ma&mdash;for
Miss Parker.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The color flamed in his face and he laughed in
an embarrassed way and spoke apologetically:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Parker has &#39;Mamie&#39; so constantly on his
tongue that the rest of us are in danger of
forgetting. He is very proud of his sister.
Why, no, mother, of course he could not very
well make any other arrangement; why should
he? Of course it is a perfectly proper thing
for a young lady to be in her brother&#39;s boarding-house.
She isn&#39;t obliged to have any more
to do with the other young men than she
chooses. Parker wants her to stay with him
all winter. Their father is a mining man,
and he and his wife have gone to the mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
somewhere among the mines to look up
some more of their money, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke almost contemptuously; for some
reason the evidence of abundance of money in
the Parker family seemed to annoy him. He
went on quickly with his labored explanations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it would be pleasanter for M&mdash;for
his sister if Parker were in a house where
there are ladies, but he has been there for several
years and has a room that suits him; he doesn&#39;t
seem to think he can make a change. Oh, yes,
there are to be ladies to-night. Some of the other
boys have sisters, and cousins, or intimate
friends; it is a very informal affair. I fancy
that Miss Parker herself is to be hostess. As
for a chaperon, I don&#39;t think they have thought
of her.&quot; He laughed in a half-embarrassed
way as he said that, and added hastily:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is really just a frolic, mother; they are
not formal people at all, under any circumstances,
I fancy. Is it possible that that clock is striking
seven! I must be off at once; Parker will
think I have forgotten my promise to see him
through from beginning to end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
What had he said to cause his mother to sit,
for an hour after his departure, as still as a stone,
her hands clasped over the neglected book in
her lap? What was making that strange
stricture around her heart as though a cold hand
had clutched her and was holding on?</p>

<p class="indent">He had kissed her good-by with almost more
tenderness than usual, if that were possible.
He had called her &quot;mommie,&quot; his special pet
name for her, and had inquired solicitously as
to whether there was any special reason for
his getting home early. If there was, why of
course&mdash;or if for any reason she would rather
not be left to-night, he could excuse himself to
Parker,&mdash;of course he could. All his friends
knew well enough that his mother came first.</p>

<p class="indent">But how relieved and pleased he had looked
when she made haste to assure him that there
was not, and that she would be quietly happy
with her book all the evening, and there was no
need at all for his hastening home. And besides&mdash;she
paused over that connecting phrase and
tried to formulate her fears. How had her son
conveyed to her heart the feeling that the time
to which it seemed to her she had always looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
forward&mdash;the time when he would look upon
some other woman with eyes that were no
longer indifferent, had come?</p>

<p class="indent">She could not have put it into words; but
though she arose, at last, and put away her
book as something that seemed to have failed
her, and sat down at her desk to spend an
hour with Marian Dennis, and abandoned her,
presently, for Flossy Shipley, and gave them
both up after the second page, and selected
another book with the firm determination to
compel herself to read it, the simple truth is
that she spent the entire evening, and a large
portion of the night as well, with one Mamie
Parker.</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p class="h3">WOULD SHE &quot;DO&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Mrs. Burnham came into
her pretty parlor, where a dainty breakfast
table was laid for two, prepared to be as wise
as a serpent over the new situation. She was
genial, sympathetic, and not too penetrative
in her questions. Erskine had come home late,
much later than he had ever been before; yet
apparently his mother had not noticed it.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not even ask at what time he had come.
In truth she needed no information, but how was
Erskine to know that?</p>

<p class="indent">Did he have a pleasant evening, and was the
occasion all that it should have been? He was
not enthusiastic. It was pleasant enough, he
said. In some respects very pleasant; only&mdash;well,
a few of the boys were noisier than was
agreeable, and two or three of them did not
apparently know how to treat ladies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing objectionable, of course,&quot; he
said quickly, in response to her startled look.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
&quot;They are so used to being alone that they
grow loud-voiced and careless about the small
proprieties, or at least courtesies; I fancy some
of their ways must have seemed peculiar to
Miss Parker.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The other girls? Oh, they are used to such
things; they were the sisters and cousins of the
boys, and the ways of a lot of fellows accustomed
chiefly to their own society would not
seem so strange to the others; but Miss Parker
is&mdash;at least I hope, I mean I think she&mdash;&quot;
He caught himself and left the sentence unfinished
save by a half-embarrassed laugh,
which changed into a slight frown.</p>

<p class="indent">While his mother rang her table bell and gave
low-voiced directions to the maid, she pondered.
What was it that Erskine hoped? That Miss
Parker was by nature more refined than the
other ladies? And was the hope well founded?
She was slightly acquainted with some of the
sisters and cousins who were probably at this
gathering. At least she had met them once or
twice and had felt no fear as to their influence
over Erskine. Was this Mamie Parker
different? She felt her face flush a little even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
over her thoughts. Must she learn to say
&quot;Mamie&quot;? One thing was certain: she must
make the acquaintance of the girl at once. She
ventured a move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this Mr. Parker so much your friend,
Erskine, that he will expect your mother to
call on his sister, or is that unnecessary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her heart beat in steady thumps while she
waited for his answer. If only he would say
in his pleasant, indifferent tone:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it isn&#39;t necessary, mother; Parker and I
are not especially intimate, and he has no reason
to expect such attentions from you.&quot; But
there was no indifference in the quick response.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mommie, you know just what, and how,
always, don&#39;t you? I was wishing for that very
thing and not wanting to trouble you. Parker
and I cannot be said to be inseparable; but he
is a good fellow, and I think you would like him
better on closer acquaintance. His sister is
very much alone here; none of those girls who
were there last night have homes or mothers; I
mean of course that they are away from home;
though I must admit that some of them acted
last night as though they had no mothers anywhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
worthy of the name. It would mean
very much to Miss Parker, mother, if she could
know you; and of course Parker would appreciate
it more than anything else that could be
done for her. You don&#39;t know how much the
boys admire my mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother managed to smile cheerfully,
and assure him that she would make the proposed
call. When he went away to his recitation
he kissed her fervently and told her she was the
dearest mother in the world; and as she watched
him out of sight, she turned from the window
and said with a kind of strange gravity:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it has come: I must pray for grace
to do right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For several days thereafter the hours that Mrs.
Burnham spent alone were unusually thoughtful
and prayerful. The feeling grew upon her that
her son had reached a critical point in his life.
It is true he was very young, not yet twenty;
but none knew better than she that boys of
twenty sometimes glorify and sometimes mar all
their future by reason of their interest in one
young woman. Also, she knew that a single false
step on her part, just now, might spoil all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
future with her son and hasten a condition of
things that she longed to postpone for him.
But she could not plan her way, could not indeed
see a single step before her until that first
one was taken: she must make that call on
Mamie Parker. While she allowed one triviality
after another to delay her, the conviction grew
upon her that the step was important. Erskine&#39;s
interest was keen; despite the sympathy there
had always been between them he had never
before shown such a lively desire to hear about
each moment of his mother&#39;s time while they
were separated. That he chose not to ask in
so many words whether or not she had yet made
that call but emphasized the situation. When,
before, had he hesitated to urge what he desired?
Moreover, he was often absent-minded and constrained;
seeming to be almost embarrassed over
his own thoughts. He could not mention the
girl&#39;s name without a heightened color, yet he
evidently planned ways of introducing it that
would sound accidental.</p>

<p class="indent">All things considered, Mrs. Burnham, as she
dressed carefully for calling, gravely admitted
to herself that she was evidently about to meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
one who, for good or ill, had taken a strong hold
upon her son&#39;s life.</p>

<p class="indent">As she waited in the large ugly parlor, where
the wall-paper was gaudily angry over the colors
in the carpet, and where every article of furniture
or ornament&mdash;of which last there were many&mdash;seemed
ready to fight with every other one,
she wondered what Erskine the fastidious thought
of this room. It seemed almost profane to
think of meeting one&#39;s ideal in such a room.
Yet she must be reasonable; of course the girl
was not to blame for the taste, or want of taste,
displayed in her brother&#39;s boarding-house.</p>

<p class="indent">She had to wait an unreasonable length of
time, and despite her furs she felt the chill of
the half-warmed room. There were a few books
on the table, but she tried in vain to find one
that would hold her thoughts. Perhaps no
book could have been expected to do that
under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she became aware that some one
else had entered an adjoining room where there
had been brisk moving about ever since her
arrival. With the coming of another, a sharp
little voice could be distinctly heard:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
&quot;Oh, say, Lucile, do come here and fasten this
waist; I&#39;m scared to pieces and my fingers all
feel like thumbs. Don&#39;t you think &#39;Ma&#39; has
come to look me over and see if I will do! Oh
dear! can&#39;t you hook it? It&#39;s awful tight, but
I&#39;ve got to be squeezed into it somehow; I&#39;m
keeping her waiting an awful while. I had on
that fright of a wrapper when she came, and my
hair in crimps. I didn&#39;t get up to breakfast
this morning; we were so horrid late last night,
I couldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ma&#39; who?&quot; said another voice. &quot;Not
Erskine Burnham&#39;s mother? You don&#39;t say
so! My land! I should think you would be
scared. They say she&#39;s awful particular who
she calls on. You must mind your p&#39;s and q&#39;s,
Mamie, or you&#39;ll never see that handsome boy
of hers again. They say she keeps him right
under her thumb all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mamie&#39;s response was in too low a tone to
penetrate into the next room, but it was
followed by explosive giggles from both talkers.
Meanwhile, the caller&#39;s face was glowing, not
only with shame for them, but with indignation.
What might <i>not</i> those coarse girls&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
was sure they were both coarse&mdash;be saying
about her son!</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened at last and a mass of fluffy
hair entered; behind which peeped a pert little
face with pink cheeks and bright, keen eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl was dressed in the extreme of the
prevailing style,&mdash;quite too much dressed for
morning, though the material of which her
garments were made was flimsy and cheap-looking.
Plainly if she had money she had not
learned how to spend it to advantage. Still the
clothes were worn with an air that hinted at
her ability to learn how to play the fine lady if
she were given the opportunity.</p>

<p class="indent">Her manner to her caller suggested a curious
mixture of timidity and bravado. She chattered
incessantly and showered slang words and
phrases about her freely; yet all the while
kept up a nervous little undertone of movement
and manner that showed she was not at ease.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, indeed, she was having an awfully good
time. Brother Jim was doing the best he could
to give her a lark. She had never been much
away from home and they lived in a stupid little
village where there was nothing going on. Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Jim was an elegant brother; he wanted her to
stay all winter and look after his buttons and
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect you have heard a good deal about
Jim, haven&#39;t you, from your son? Only he
calls him &#39;Parker&#39; instead of Jim; the boys all
do that, you know. It&#39;s &#39;Parker,&#39; and &#39;Burnham,&#39;
and all the rest of them. Ain&#39;t it funny, instead
of using their first names? I s&#39;pose that&#39;s
the college of it; but your son has such a pretty
name it seems a pity not to use it. Don&#39;t you
think Erskine is an awful pretty name? I do.
It has such an aristocratic sound. Ma says
I ought to have been born with a silver spoon in
my mouth, I like aristocratic things so well.
Not but what we&#39;ve got money enough;&quot;&mdash;this
with an airy toss of the frizzed head. Then,
in a confidential tone: &quot;But I may as well own
to you that it didn&#39;t pan out until a little
while ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham, as she took her thoughtful
way home, too much exhausted with this effort
to think of making another call, studied in vain
the problem of her son&#39;s enthralment.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl was pretty, certainly, with a kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
garish, unfinished beauty, not unlike that of a
pert doll; and her chatter, if one could divest
one&#39;s self of all thought of interest in the chatterer
save in the way of a moment&#39;s diversion,
was rather entertaining than otherwise, when
it was not too much mixed with slang; but
what Erskine, her cultivated and always fastidious
son, could find in the empty little brain
to attract him was beyond the mother&#39;s comprehension.
But he must have been pronounced
in his attentions. Had she not been reported
as having called to see if the girl would &quot;do&quot;?
Ruth&#39;s sensitive face flushed over the memory.
Should she tell that to Erskine? What should
she tell to Erskine? How should the place and
the interview and her impressions of the entire
scene be described? It required serious thought.
The more the mother considered it, the more
sure she felt that much of Erskine&#39;s future might
turn on the way in which she, his mother, conducted
herself just now. She puzzled long and
reached no clearer conclusion than that until
she saw her way clearer she would take no steps
at all, and would be entirely noncommittal in
her statements. This she found hard; Erskine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
was curious, more curious than she had ever
before known him to be. He cross-questioned her
closely as to her call, and was openly regretful,
almost annoyed, at her having so little to tell.
In the course of the next few days the watching
mother, who yet did not wish to appear to watch,
knew of at least two social functions that included
her son and Miss Parker. One was a
sleigh-ride which fell on the evening of the mid-week
prayer-meeting in the church they were
attending. Erskine had been scrupulous in his
attendance on this meeting, declining for it
social and business engagements alike, sometimes
to his own inconvenience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was no use in compromising about
these matters,&quot; he said. &quot;Busy people can
find something important to detain them
every week of their lives if they once admit an
exception. The only way is to set one&#39;s face
like a flint and march ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But he came to her with profuse apologies for
this exception; Parker had planned, without
knowing anything about the prayer-meeting;
he had not been brought up to think of such
things, and it was going to embarrass him very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
much if he declined. He wouldn&#39;t have had it
happen in this way for a great deal, and he should
take care to let Parker know in the future that
Thursday evening belonged to his mother and
to no one else. He himself arranged for her
to have agreeable company to and from the
church, and she had grace to be sweet and
cheerfully acquiescent in all his plans. Nevertheless
she owned, quite to herself, that she
felt in a strange, new sense alone. She was
more straitened in her praying that evening
than she had been for months, almost for years.
There was a miserable undertone question hovering
about each petition: Could it be possible
that she must teach herself to pray for Mamie
Parker, not as a passing acquaintance but as
one of her very own? and could she learn such
a lesson? She had by no means settled it that
such a catastrophe must come upon them,
but she could not keep down her forebodings.</p>

<p class="indent">It was two days afterwards that Mrs. Burnham,
having at last reached a decision, made another
very careful move. It was discussed over the
cosey breakfast which she and Erskine took together
in her parlor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
&quot;Would he like to have her ask Mr. Parker
and his sister in to dinner on some evening
soon? or would that indicate a greater degree of
intimacy with the young man than he cared to
live up to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sudden stricture at her heart over
the flash of pleasure on her son&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mommie, you are a jewel!&quot; this was his
first outburst. &quot;Parker would be everlastingly
obliged to you for such an attention.
You see he knows very few people here of the
sort that he would care to have his sister visit.
Most of his friends are just college boys away
from home, and Parker has ideas about his
sister&#39;s associates. He is a real good fellow,
Mommie; if he had had one-third of my opportunities,
he would have made more of them, I
believe, than I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother did not choose to argue that
question. She felt a wicked temptation to
say that she would be glad if she need never
hear his name again; but she restrained herself
and asked another question.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chV" id="chV"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p class="h3">THE OLD CAT!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;Would</span> he like to have one or two
young people asked to meet them?
Alice Warder, for instance, and her cousin.
How would they do?&quot; Did his face cloud a
little?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said slowly, and his voice
suggested a cloud, or at least a diminution of
his pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that necessary, do you think, mother?
It is not as though we were at home, of course.
Several guests at one time would hardly be
expected at a boarding-house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother reminded him of their hostess&#39;s
cordial offer of a separate table for themselves
and three or four guests whenever they cared
to give her a half-day&#39;s notice; and added
that Alice was so used to being called upon to
help entertain their guests, that to count her
out would seem almost strange to her. Besides,
wouldn&#39;t this be a convenient time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
show her cousin some attention? He was not
to be with her long.</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently Erskine had no more arguments
to offer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; he said. Those were matters
for her to settle, and it must all be just as she
thought, of course. Then he kissed her,
lavishly, and went away; but she felt that
she had destroyed much of his pleasure in the
proposed visit. And he used to be so fond of
Alice!</p>

<p class="indent">During the next two days she spent much
time and thought over her little boarding-house
dinner-party. She had adhered to her
resolve to include Alice and her cousin among
the guests, although she had given herself time
to look steadily in the face the reason why she
was so insistent about this when Erskine evidently
desired it otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">Alice Warder was Flossy Shipley&#39;s dear friend,
and being introduced by her to the Burnhams
was at once established on the footing of an old
friend. It had taken but a very short time to
learn to love her for herself. Even the careful
mother of one son of marriageable age would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
have found it hard to find flaws in Alice Warder.
She was beautiful to look upon, with regular,
well-modelled features and a complexion that
was faultless. Perhaps her great brown eyes
were what a stranger noticed first; they were
certainly very expressive. But she was much
more than beautiful. There was about her a
charm of manner and movement that are difficult
to define and impossible to describe, but
that made their invariable impression even on
those who met her casually. Ruth Burnham,
who in her womanhood was, as she had been
in her girlhood, fastidious to a fault with regard
to young women, had yielded to the subtle
charm of this one at their very first meeting;
and as the intimacy between them deepened
into friendship she had found graces of heart
and mind that fully harmonized with the lovely
exterior.</p>

<p class="indent">The Warders bought a home very near to
the Burnham place, and so far as social life was
concerned the two families speedily became as
one.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham, singularly enough, as she reflected
afterward, had not once, during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
early days of their friendship, coupled the
names of Alice and Erskine in her thoughts,
congenial as they were. Although they were
almost to a day of the same age, Alice, who had
been for several years the nominal head of her
father&#39;s house, appeared much the older, and
more like a mature young woman than a girl
still in the charge of a governess. It might
have been this apparent disparity in their ages
that helped Mrs. Burnham to take the girl to
her heart and think of her as the daughter she
had often wished for; not by any means as
Erskine&#39;s wife, but as his sister.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine had been from the first of their
acquaintance drawn to the young woman in
the frank and brotherly way that his mother
desired. When the plans for college were
matured, one of the loudly spoken regrets on
the part of both mother and son was that they
must be separated from the Warders.</p>

<p class="indent">It came to pass, however, in the course of
their second year of absence that Mr. Warder
had occasion to make the college town his
headquarters for several months; so Alice and
her former governess were installed in one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
the hotels for the winter, that her father might
have as much of her company as possible; and
the Burnhams rejoiced greatly thereat.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet here was Erskine, barely six weeks afterwards,
considering it not necessary to invite
Alice to dinner! The poor mother sighed over
the perversity and the blindness of young manhood,
and knew for the first time that if Erskine
had developed the peculiar interest which Miss
Parker seemed to have awakened, for Alice
Warder, instead, she could have rejoiced with
her whole heart.</p>

<p class="indent">They came to dinner, Alice and her Boston
cousin, a Harvard student of marked ability,
and Miss Parker and her brother. And Alice
was fully as marked a contrast to the other
young woman as Ruth had believed that she
would be. First, in the matter of dress. Alice
Warder was an artist in dress. She wore at
this quiet little dinner party a cloth gown of
olive-green, so severely plain in its make-up
that its richness of texture and faultless workmanship
were apparent. And Miss Parker appeared
in an elbow-sleeved white dress badly
laundered and profusely trimmed with a quantity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
of lace that was startling rather than fine.
Moreover, she was adorned with a mass of hothouse
blooms to which she referred so significantly
that the little company were at once
made aware that Erskine was the giver.</p>

<p class="indent">But the dress was perfection compared with
the poor girl&#39;s manner. She gayly and unblushingly
appropriated Erskine to herself and
rallied her brother on the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Jim! you haven&#39;t any girl at all, have
you? Since Miss Warder&mdash;must I call you
&#39;Miss Warder&#39;? it sounds ever so much more
friendly and cosey to say &#39;Alice.&#39; You must
look after your cousin, I suppose. Are you
sure he is your cousin? You know that is a
dodge girls have when&mdash;Oh, well, never mind;
I won&#39;t bother you. This is good for Jim; he
always has half a dozen strings to his bow and
can never decide which one of them he wants
the most; so this will be excellent discipline for
him, leaving him out in the cold. Dear me!
What am I talking about? Here is Mrs.
Burnham looking young enough this minute to
be one of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this, while they were making their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
through the boarding-house halls and large
dining-room to a cosey little alcove, where a
table had been set for the Burnhams and their
guests. Erskine&#39;s face had flushed deeply
during the outburst, and he had darted an
annoyed look at his mother to see if she was
hearing it. He led the way across the dining-room
much to the irrepressible Mamie&#39;s disappointment,
though she chose to seem to
ridicule it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me!&quot; she said in a stage whisper to
Alice, &quot;do look at that ridiculous boy walking
off alone. Where I come from, the fellows take
the girls out to supper. Can&#39;t I borrow your
cousin for this evening, and get even with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham felt the color rising in her face,
but Alice was gracious and lovely. She laughed
pleasantly as though used to such jokes, linked
her arm in the girl&#39;s, and said merrily:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will give them all the slip, my dear, and
go in together.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 401px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">We will give them all the slip, my dear.</span>&quot;&mdash;<i>Page 61.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Throughout that embarrassing and long-drawn-out
dinner Alice was a help and comfort
at least to her hostess, and did steadily and
patiently what she could to cover the blunders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
of the girl beside her. Utterly unaccustomed
to even the formalities of a fashionable boarding-house
table, Mamie made constant blunders
with forks and spoons and other instruments of
torture for the uninitiated; but these were trifles
compared with the blunders of her tongue.
She made evident attempts to cover her
ignorance with regard to table formalities by
much gay talk. She laughed incessantly, and
told many jokes at her brother&#39;s expense. She
said: &quot;him and me,&quot; and &quot;her and I,&quot; and
&quot;you folks,&quot; and a dozen other provincialisms.
When they returned to Mrs. Burnham&#39;s parlor,
it was almost worse&mdash;for then Mamie sang;
and it was hard for her hostess to determine of
which she was most ashamed, the bad taste of
the girl&#39;s selections or the less than mediocre
execution.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, the music was by no means the worst
feature of that memorable hour. Mamie&#39;s next
startling venture was a pretence of being
offended by what she called Erskine&#39;s desertion
of her at dinner-time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you needn&#39;t come around,&quot; she said
rudely, as he rose to arrange her music. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
can fix things myself, thank you, and Mr. Colchester
will turn the music for me, I know;
won&#39;t you, Mr. Colchester?&quot; with a jaunty little
smile for the stately Boston cousin. &quot;You
can&#39;t make up for rudeness to me, sir, as easy
as you think. I make fellows who want my
company mind their p&#39;s and q&#39;s, don&#39;t I, Jim?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stalwart brother thus appealed to replied
only by a slight embarrassed laugh, and
the hostess had time out of her own embarrassment
to bestow a swift glance of pity upon
him. He had already seen enough of another
sort of world to realize that his pretty, pert
little sister, the idol of his country home, was
not making as good an impression on these new
friends of his as he wished she were. If the
ladies had but known it, the poor young fellow
was at that moment saying to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why can&#39;t Mamie act more like that Miss
Warder, I wonder? There&#39;s an awful difference
between them, and she doesn&#39;t catch on, somehow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the interminable evening, Alice
Warder proved not only the excellent foil that
Mrs. Burnham had foreseen, but a faithful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
efficient coadjutor. Not a lift of her eyebrows
or a stray glance of any kind betrayed a second&#39;s
surprise at the character of the guests invited
to meet her dignified cousin and herself. She
was gracious and friendly to such an extent
that before the evening was over, Mamie, who
was frankness itself, said admiringly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long you going to stay in this
place? Dear me! I wish you was going to be
here all winter; I can see that you and me
would be real cronies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the privacy of Mrs. Burnham&#39;s bedroom,
whither Alice was taken to put on her wraps,
the girl bestowed her closing touch of sweetness
and balm upon her hostess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had quite a little visit with Mr. Parker
while you were entertaining the others with
those pictures; I was much interested in him;
he is a young man of good principle, isn&#39;t he?
One on whom education will tell. It is lovely
in you and Erskine to open your home to him
in this way; it will be sure to mean much to
him; and it ought to help the little sister, too.
It is pleasant to see how fond he is of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You helped,&quot; said Mrs. Burnham, significantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;I am more grateful for your help
to-night than the mere words will express.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She kissed her as she spoke, and felt in her
heart that she was willing that Erskine should
marry this girl to-morrow, if he would.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was glad of the opportunity,&quot; the girl
said simply. &quot;And so, I am sure, was Ranford.
He is very much interested in young men of this
type.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a full half hour after &quot;Jim&quot; had carried
off his pouting sister,&mdash;whose parting shot
had been that she considered it &quot;awfully
pokey&quot; for a girl to go home from a dinner-party
with &quot;nothing but her brother&quot;&mdash;spoken
in a pretended confidence to him, but
loud enough for all to hear,&mdash;silence reigned in
the Burnham parlor.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine had a desk in one of its corners,
where he kept certain of his books, and studied,
whenever he chose to remain with his mother.
He flung himself down before it the moment
the door closed after their guests, as though
work pressed hard.</p>

<p class="indent">His mother took a book and sat silent and
apparently absorbed, although as a matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
fact, instead of reading, she was studying the
half-averted face that was drawn in almost
stern lines, and the eyes that stared at the
open page as though they did not see its words.
She did not believe that Erskine was studying
Latin.</p>

<p class="indent">What had this terrible evening done for him,
and for her? Had that pretty-faced, ill-dressed,
ill-bred girl secured in some unaccountable
way a permanent hold on her son&#39;s
heart? Might it not be possible that in giving
him this awful view of her in sharp contrast
with Alice Warder she had but alienated him
from herself? Perhaps she had blundered, and
perhaps the consequences of her blunder would
be fatal to them both. Why had she done it?
Why had she not waited, and watched, and
understood better before she attempted anything?
What should she do now? How was
she to bear this silence? And yet, what
might not Erskine say when at last he broke
it?</p>

<p class="indent">A half-hour passed and neither mother nor
son had turned a page. Suddenly he wheeled
his chair around so that she could get a full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
view of his face, and smiled a half-sad, half-whimsical
smile, and spoke his word:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe we can do it, Mommie. It
was good in you to try, and you did it royally,
as you do things, but&mdash;she can&#39;t be assimilated.
She doesn&#39;t belong. We shall have to wait until
she goes home before we can do much for
Parker. All the same, mother, you understand
that I thank you for the effort. Alice
was superb to-night, wasn&#39;t she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Ruth Burnham understood that it was
her business to understand that her son&#39;s
interest lay solely in the young man Parker,
and that in the desire to help the brother the
sister must be thought of as simply tolerated.
Already Erskine had put away his first illusion
so utterly that he did not propose to own it to
himself, much less to his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Mamie Parker spent her fruitless winter
in the college town, and tried by many innocent
and a few questionable ways to win back to
interest and special attention her brother&#39;s
handsome friend, whose sudden defection she
could not understand. She tortured herself in
a vain effort to discover what could have happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
on that evening which she had expected
to be memorable to her for other reasons than
now appeared. Why had it so utterly changed
the attitude toward her of the young man who,
she had confidently assured Jim, was &quot;caught,
all right,&quot; she &quot;knew the signs&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent">By degrees, without any clearly defined reason
for doing so, she came to associate the defection
with the young man&#39;s mother, and called her
&quot;that old cat!&quot; with a bitterness that had
more than mere anger behind it; there was a
lump in her throat and a curious stricture about
the little organ that she called her heart, which
was new to the frivolous girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim&#39;s handsome college friend had afforded
his sister Mamie a glimpse into a new, strange
world, one that she felt she could have loved,
and in which she believed that she could have
shone; and in some way, she did not understand
how, his mother had closed the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old cat!&quot; she said. &quot;I should like to
get even with her!&quot; And then she cried.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chVI" id="chVI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p class="h3">IDEAL CONDITIONS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Erskine</span> Burnham&#39;s lesson was short,
but sharp, and he seemed to have learned
it thoroughly. He gave himself more persistently
to study than before, and was even more
devoted to his mother than ever, if that were
possible. He let the visiting sisters of freshmen
and sophomores dignifiedly alone, and
resisted without a sigh numerous attempts to
draw him into local society circles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven&#39;t time for society just now,&quot; was his
invariable excuse. &quot;Nor inclination,&quot; he
would add privately for his mother&#39;s benefit.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally the mother urged the acceptance
of an invitation and begged him not to make a
recluse of himself for her sake; but he met her
suggestions with his whimsical smile and the
gay retort that a society composed of two
entirely congenial people met all his present
requirements. She was not insistent. Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
should she be, when Erskine was undeniably
happy in the life he had planned?</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly it was an ideal life for the fond
mother; for both of them, perhaps. It had
been unique from the first of Erskine&#39;s college
course. They had been settled but a few
weeks in their new home when Mrs. Burnham,
finding much time at her disposal, proposed to
Erskine that she take up some of her long-ago-dropped
studies and let him introduce her to
modern college ways. The young man laughed
as he gave her an admiring glance and assured
her that she knew more than other women,
already. Nevertheless it pleased him to go
into careful detail about his work, and on the
following day it surprised as well as pleased
him to find that his mother was quite as well
prepared with some of his studies as he was
himself. From that evening a new order of
things was established; Mrs. Burnham, without
matriculating as a college student, and without
letting it be known, save to the choice few
who were their very intimate friends, became
nevertheless a student. How much of Erskine
Burnham&#39;s acknowledged success in college was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
due to the fact that his mother studied with
him throughout the entire course is something
that will never be known; but her son gave
her full credit for the help that she was to
him. From the first he recognized her as a
stimulant; he discovered that he must have his
points very fully in his grasp in order to explain
them satisfactorily to his pupil. She
always insisted on being his pupil and kept
carefully the subordinate place, although her
keen questionings more than once led him to
change his view of a subject under discussion.</p>

<p class="indent">Altogether, it was a life replete with satisfaction
to both mother and son. Not that
they shut themselves away from society. Such
of his friends as Erskine thought his mother
would enjoy or could help he brought freely to
their rooms, and between several of the students
and herself there was built up by degrees that
kind of friendship which one occasionally sees
between self-respecting young men and certain
middle-aged women. It was a very pleasant
experience, and it made Ruth feel, as she expressed
it to Erskine, that she had several sons
always ready to serve her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
Neither did they wholly neglect the outside
world. Both mother and son held carefully
to their resolve not to let college or any other
functions interfere with their Sunday and mid-week
engagements in the church of their choice,
and through this channel they made certain
acquaintances that ripened into friendship. But
there came a time in the mother&#39;s life when she
wished, not that she had enjoyed her studies
with Erskine less, but that both of them had
given more time and thought and enjoyment to
distinctively religious themes and duties.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime their friendship for Alice Warder
ripened and deepened, although there had been
an interim during which its very life had seemed
to be threatened. Following that painful episode
with Mamie Parker, Erskine had seemed
to shun even Alice Warder. He had not from
the first been entirely sure that he cared to see
much of her Boston cousin, and presently made
him an excuse for seeing little of Alice, for the
cousin seemed to be staying indefinitely. This
state of things lasted until the college year
closed and they went home, and became again
next-door neighbors to the Warders. At first,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
it seemed to Mrs. Burnham that the old friendship
was lost. Something very vague and intangible,
but distinctly felt, seemed to have
come between them. Then, suddenly, whatever
it was, it passed. On a certain evening
that stood out plainly afterward in the mother&#39;s
memory Alice had appeared at her window
with an air of decision, and a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Erskine come in yet, Mrs. Burnham?
When he comes, will you ask him if he can
give me an uninterrupted half-hour this evening
for something special?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Later, the mother wondered, and often
wondered what that something special was, but
she had not been told. It was something that
made a marked difference in Erskine&#39;s manner.
From apparently avoiding Alice Warder&#39;s society
as much as possible, he frankly sought it; proposing
her as a third on occasions when his
mother would have hesitated, and in every
possible way proclaiming that the old cordial
relations were reestablished. From that time
on, the young woman next door became so
entirely identified with the daily life of the
Burnhams that the intimate friends of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
family said &quot;Alice and Erskine,&quot; quite as a
matter of course.</p>

<p class="indent">In the fall they went back to college, mother
and son. At least that was Erskine&#39;s way of
putting it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot; he said, laughing at his mother&#39;s
protest. &quot;You are as much in college as I am.
They ought to give you a diploma. I believe
I&#39;ll divide mine; have the sheepskin cut exactly
in two, and your name inserted. Half of my
honors belong to you, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During his senior year Erskine and Alice
Warder were more inseparable than ever. Mr.
Warder went abroad on an extended business
trip, which was so entirely business that he
would have little or no time for Alice, and she
chose to be left behind. But her friend who
had lived with her as a companion, since she
had ceased to be a governess, wanted the winter
for her personal friends, so it was decided that
Alice should secure rooms at the same house
where the Burnhams boarded and be chaperoned
by Mrs. Burnham. This made them
practically one family, though each adhered to
his own programme. Alice gave much time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
correspondence, and interested herself at once
in special church work; while Mrs. Burnham
continued to study with her son. But in all
social functions, and indeed, in all their
leisure time, they were together quite as a
family.</p>

<p class="indent">It was during this winter that Mrs. Burnham
took up a study quite by herself and made
diligent effort in it. This was the study of adjusting
herself to new relations. She was getting
acquainted with and growing used to her
daughter, she told herself hopefully; for by this
time she had fully decided that Alice Warder
was the one who was to share through all
their future Erskine&#39;s love and care. She grew
more than reconciled; she told herself that she
was perfectly happy in Erskine&#39;s choice; that
of course she wanted him to marry, she had
always wanted it; and where in all the earth
could he have found a more lovely character or
a more entirely acceptable person in every way
than Alice Warder? It really seemed as though
a special Providence had planned and created
them each for the other.</p>

<p class="indent">As the intimacy deepened, so that the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
seemed to think in unison, the mother told herself
cheerfully that it was almost as though
the two were married already; there would be
no strange chasm to bridge over when that
time came; nor would they have to readjust
themselves in any way. Alice had not known
a mother&#39;s love and care since childhood, and
she turned as naturally to Mrs. Burnham for
mothering as though they were really mother
and daughter. It was all ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">There were times, of course, when Mrs. Burnham
could not help sitting in secret judgment on
certain ways and words of this daughter of hers.
She would allow herself to wish that this or that
had been different, and then would bring herself
to order with severity, assuring herself that
she had no right to expect perfection, and
where, on this earth, could there be found another
girl so near it as Alice?</p>

<p class="indent">Over one phase of the girl&#39;s life this mother
in all sincerity rejoiced. Alice was unquestionably
and deeply religious. Her Christian
life was deep-rooted and pervasive, and the
perfume of its flowering filled her days. To
come in contact with her for even a short interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
was to discover that religion with her was
not merely a duty, but a joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alice is very unusual in this respect,&quot; Ruth
said to Erskine. &quot;It isn&#39;t simply that she is
regular and methodical in her Christianity as
in everything else. I have seen girls before
who went to prayer-meeting, for instance,
regularly, from a sense of duty; but with Alice
it is this, and something more. She looks forward
to it as a pleasure; and she comes from
it uplifted and advanced in her Christian experience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine was hearty in his response.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Alice takes hold of life generally with
a kind of joyful enthusiasm that is delicious.
And there is contagion in it; I enjoy the mid-week
meetings better myself, since I have
learned to plan for them as she does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Everything considered, that last year of
college life passed all too quickly, at least for
Mrs. Burnham. There were times when she
realized that the peculiarly close relations which
she and her son had sustained for four beautiful
winters could not, in reason, continue, and she
shrank from any change. Yet for the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
part she was strong in her gratitude that her
son&#39;s college life had been what it had been,
and that the most censorious could not discover
any evil results from this long, close
fellowship with his mother. There were still
years of study for him. It had been decided
that he would study law in the city where his
father had practised it, and live at the old
homestead, making daily trips to and from the
larger city. In due course of time, therefore,
they were once more settled at home for an
indefinite period. Alice Warder had gone to
the coast of Maine for a long-promised visit
among her mother&#39;s relatives, but on her return,
the Warders were again to become next-door
neighbors.</p>

<p class="indent">Already in her letters to Mrs. Burnham,
which were quite as frequent as those to Erskine,
Alice Warder was planning certain functions in
which &quot;You and father, and Erskine and I&quot;
were in evidence.</p>

<p class="indent">There was one feature of the situation that
troubled the mother. As the days passed the
question which it involved grew more and
more insistent. Why did not Erskine, at least,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
confide in her? Had he not from his very
babyhood been in the habit of bringing to her
not only every joy and sorrow, but every passing
emotion or fancy, however trivial, until she
had believed them as nearly one as it was possible
for two people to become? Why then, in
this supreme decision of his life, had she in a
sense been counted out? No hint as to his new
hopes and plans had been put into words for
her; she had simply been left like the rest of
the world to take things for granted.</p>

<p class="indent">There were times when this question probed
her keenly. She struggled to discover whether
she had been in fault. Despite her earnest
efforts to hold herself well in check and give
no sign of certain emotions which every true
mother must feel at such an hour, had she
failed? Had she appeared cold, or indifferent,
or, worse than either, jealous? Despite her
careful cross-examination of herself she could
not lay her finger upon any word or act that
she could make different; and she was obliged
to content herself with redoubling her efforts to
show her entire acceptance of Alice as one of
them; but so far as any special confidences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
were concerned she did it in vain. Both
Erskine and Alice were entirely frank in their
manifest interest in each other, acting at all
times as though they had nothing to conceal.
They had even reached the stage when they
claimed each other&#39;s time and attention as a
matter of course, and so expressed themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine, for instance, would glance at a note
that had been laid on his desk a short time
before, and explain to his mother:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall have to defer my call on Dr. West,
mother, until some other evening. Alice has
to meet her committee at the hall, and wants
me to take her over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Could anything, argued the mother, indicate
more surely that they two had already passed
the early stages of sentiment, and begun to
realize that they belonged to each other for
convenience as well as for love? Then why did
they not confide in his mother, <i>their</i> mother?</p>

<p class="indent">No comparatively small matter had ever
troubled Ruth Burnham more than did this
one. There were times when she felt almost
indignant, and was on the verge of saying to
them both that she did not think she deserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
such careless treatment at their hands. Why,
her very intimate friends were almost asking
when the wedding was to be! There were
other times when she told herself that she
would not be the first to speak, even though
they kept silence until the wedding day was
come.</p>

<p class="indent">Matters were in this state when she reached
another distinct milestone in the singularly
marked journey of her life.</p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p class="h3">&quot;MOTHERS ARE QUEER!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was but the week before Alice&#39;s expected
return, and Mrs. Burnham was out paying
afternoon visits. She had confessed to Erskine
that she wanted to get them off of her mind
before Alice came, and be able to give undivided
attention to her for a while.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can imagine how I
have missed her,&quot; she added in a voice that
she intended to express archness, but which
was almost wistful. He felt the wistfulness
and mistook its cause, and said tenderly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor little mother! you need a daughter,
don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had turned from him abruptly to hide
the glimmer of tears; and she had told herself
almost angrily afterward that it was time she
had learned self-control.</p>

<p class="indent">At the home of one of her friends she met a
Mrs. Carson, with whom she had also a calling
acquaintance. Mrs. Carson had been spending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
some weeks in Boston, and had no sooner exchanged
greetings with Mrs. Burnham than she
brought out with eager hand from her news
budget a choice morsel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what do you both think I heard just
before I left the city? At first I could scarcely
believe my ears; in fact, I did not credit the
news at all; I said it could not be so; I am
sure, dear Mrs. Burnham, you will understand
why. But afterward it was so signally confirmed
that I was obliged to accept it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me!&quot; said the hostess, &quot;this is quite
exciting. Do enlighten us, Mrs. Carson. We
have been so humdrum here this fall that news
is thrice welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would never guess my news, I am sure,
that is, you would not, Mrs. Webster; but there
sits our dear Mrs. Burnham, looking as calm and
unconcerned as usual, though I presume she
has known all about it this long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you arouse my curiosity, certainly,&quot;
that lady said with a quiet smile. &quot;I don&#39;t
recall any special news from Boston, of late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well, I don&#39;t suppose it is late news to
you, but it certainly was to me. Why, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Webster, I have it on excellent authority that
our friend Alice Warder is engaged to her
cousin, Ranford Colchester, and the marriage is
to take place very soon. Now do you wonder
that I was simply amazed over such an announcement?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham took her startled nerves into
instant and stern check, and was entirely silent
while Mrs. Webster exclaimed and expostulated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you you wouldn&#39;t be able to believe
it,&quot; said the gratified news-dealer. &quot;Such a
surprise to us all! and yet you see this naughty
woman doesn&#39;t express any, and hasn&#39;t a word
to say for herself! Dear Mrs. Burnham, it isn&#39;t
necessary I suppose for us to confess that we
have been waiting these many weeks for the
formal announcement of her engagement to an
entirely different person? Her cousin, indeed!
why I thought they were the same as brother
and sister. I was never more surprised in my
life. At first I simply disputed it and assured
my friends that Alice Warder was as good as
married, already. But it came to me too
straight to be disputed. It&#39;s this way. My
aunt has a young niece living with her this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
year who is a very intimate friend of Miriam
Stevens, and she, you know, is Mr. Colchester&#39;s
stepdaughter; and she told her all about it.
It seems, although they have been engaged for
a very long time, years and years, Miriam said,
the engagement has just been announced. Mr.
Colchester, the father, of course, has opposed
the match, because it interfered with some of
his pet plans. There was an old love story
connected with it, don&#39;t you know, and a good
deal of sentiment and obstinacy on the part of
the old gentleman, who has always thought that
the world was made for his convenience. But
he found that his son could be obstinate too;
he was willing to marry Alice Warder, and he
would never, no never, marry anybody else.
Then Alice decided that she would show a
little spirit, and she refused to come into the
family so long as there was a breath of opposition.
Nobody knows just what has happened,
at least Miriam doesn&#39;t; but she says that her
stepfather has not only withdrawn his opposition,
but seems quite as eager as his son to have
the marriage take place. Miriam did not think
that the day had been fixed yet, but she felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
sure it would be not later than Christmas.
Now, isn&#39;t that a romantic story, and a startling
one? Just think how that girl has stolen a
march on us when we thought we understood
all about her future, and were breathlessly awaiting
our invitations to the wedding! And here
sits our dear Mrs. Burnham, looking as unconcerned
as possible; though all this while she
has been helping deceive us into the belief that
Alice Warder was almost her daughter!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">How Ruth Burnham got away from their
volubility and their playful accusations and
their congratulations she was never afterward
able to clearly explain, even to herself. She
knew that her brain felt on fire, and every
nerve in her body seemed to be quivering, but
she also knew that she had one supreme determination,
not by word or glance to betray consternation
or surprise or indeed feeling of any
sort. Since these women believed that she had
deceived them, let them by all means continue
to do so, at least until she could determine what
she thought, or what she was to say.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that she preserved her outward
calm, and made some commonplace reply to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
the eager questioning exclamations showered
upon her. She remembered murmuring something
about young people&#39;s secrets being sacred
to themselves, and then she got herself away
and walked the seven squares between her and
her home, and wished that there were more of
them, that she might have time to steady herself
and plan what step to take next. How,
for instance, was she to break this terrible piece
of news to Erskine?</p>

<p class="indent">To her astonishment she found that she was
giving full credit to the story. Although the
details had been too minute and the source of
information too terribly reliable to admit of
reasonable doubt, yet her reason told her that
she ought to be able to turn in contempt from
such a story. How was it possible for Alice
Warder to be guilty of such long-drawn-out unpardonable
hypocrisy as this? Alice Warder
of all women in the world! How had it been
possible for her to deceive Erskine in this way?
Why had she done it? What could have been
her motive? Had she simply and deliberately
flirted with him, to show that insufferable old
man that there were others besides his son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
who wanted her? Poor Erskine! poor trusting,
deceived heart! What could his mother
do or say to soften such a revelation as this!
Finally she walked quite past her own door,
adding several more blocks to the already long
distance, before she had herself under sufficient
control to meet her son. For the first
time in her life she was glad that he was not in
when she reached home; and glad again that
when he came a friend was with him, who remained
to dinner. This enabled her to watch
Erskine closely, without his observing it, and
to determine whether he might have heard
from some other source the strange news.</p>

<p class="indent">She decided that he had not; he was even
more full of good cheer than usual, and referred
several times to Alice, as his guest was also her
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham&#39;s unusual quiet finally called
forth solicitous inquiries from her son. Had
she overwearied herself that afternoon? Had
there been any accident or detention that had
worn upon her? She made haste to reassure
him, and struggled to appear at ease; while all
the time her mind was busy with the problem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
of how to break her news to Erskine. The
more she thought about it, the more strangely
improbable it seemed. Alice Warder engaged
to be married to any one but Erskine! As for
the cruel wickedness of the girl whom she had
loved and trusted as a daughter, the woman
who felt herself betrayed could not trust her
thoughts just yet in that direction. She must
give all there was of her to Erskine.</p>

<p class="indent">When their visitor had gone, Erskine gave
himself in earnest to anxiety about his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot remember ever to have seen you
look so wan and worn. Is it simply the making
calls that has exhausted you? I remember I
used to notice that that was an exhausting
function for you. I wouldn&#39;t do it any more,
Mommie; let people come to you. Where did
you go? and what was said to tire you so? or
was it what they didn&#39;t say? I have noticed
that ladies when making calls never seem to
really say anything. They talk a good deal,
but then!&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If he only knew what they had said that
day! How should she tell him?</p>

<p class="indent">They went to the library; Erskine bemoaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
the fact that he had some work which must be
done, and could not read to her. But he would
establish her among the cushions where she
could rest, and he could look at her occasionally.
So she lay there, outwardly quiet, looking
steadily at him as though she must see his very
soul, and going on with her problem. Was she
being cruel, too, lying quietly there concealing
a weapon with which she was presently to stab
him? If she could only decide upon the least
terrible way of telling him what she had heard!
She planned and discarded a dozen forms of
speech, and finally plunged headlong into the
baldest and most commonplace of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine had risen to close a door, and then
had come to adjust her cushions and ask if she
were comfortable. And then&mdash;should she like
him by and by, when he had run over two or
three more pages, to read to her? There was a
magazine article he had been saving up to enjoy
with her. Or was she too tired to-night for
reading?</p>

<p class="indent">And she had caught his hand and held it
in a nervous grip while she exploded her
news.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
&quot;I heard something very strange this afternoon,
Erskine; something that I do not in the
least understand. I don&#39;t know how to credit
it, yet it came to me very straight. Mrs.
Carson has just returned from Boston, and has
it, she says, from one of the family that Alice
Warder is soon to be married to her cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She felt breathless. She did not know
whether to look at her victim or to look mercifully
away from him. He was leaning forward
in the act of tucking a refractory cushion into
place, and he persisted in conquering the
cushion before he spoke. Then he said cheerfully:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is out at last, is it? Alice must feel
relieved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother pushed all the cushions recklessly
and sat upright.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine,&quot; she said eagerly, &quot;what do you
mean? You don&#39;t mean, you <i>can&#39;t</i> mean that
you knew it all the while!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, mother? have known it for
months, might say years. It had to be
a profound secret, though, on account of old
Mr. Colchester&#39;s state of mind; he had other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
plans, you see, and at first he utterly refused
to side with the young people; then Alice refused
to enter the family so long as there was
any objection to her, and also refused to have
her engagement made public; it has been a
long, wearisome time; I am glad for both of
them that the struggle is over. I have served
them to the best of my abilities, but I can see
that the new order of things will be a comfort
to both; to all three of us indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed a little over that last admission,
but his mother had not yet recovered from her
first amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine, why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed again and bent over to kiss her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mommie, you speak as though at the least
I had committed forgery. How could I tell
you, dearest? It was another&#39;s secret. Alice
was absurdly sensitive, it is true, but of course
I had to respect her wishes. She is not accustomed
to being objected to, you know.
There was a sense in which I came upon their
secret at first, by accident, which served to
make me doubly careful; I did not feel that I
could speak of it even to you; though I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
own that I thought it extremely foolish in
Alice not to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you feel like being read to, mamma, or
would you rather be entirely quiet to-night?
Do you feel a little bit rested?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; she told him eagerly. She
was very much rested; in fact she did not feel
tired at all; she would like exceedingly to be
read to; or she was ready to do anything that
he wished.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her curiously, and a trifle
anxiously. There was something about his
mother this evening that he did not understand.
A few minutes ago she had looked pale and worn
to a degree that was unusual; now her cheeks
were flushed and her eyes were very bright.
Could she be feverish? he wondered. And he
mentally vowed vengeance on all formal calls.</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly a week afterward that Erskine
and Alice, walking home together from some
society function, lapsed into confidential talk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you find my mother?&quot; Erskine
asked. &quot;Was she able to be as glad over it all
as you could wish?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was lovely,&quot; said Alice, enthusiastically.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
&quot;An own mother could not have shown more
tenderness and lovingness. I have missed my
mother all my life, Erskine, but I shall miss
her less, even during this time when a girl needs
her mother most, because you are so kind in
lending me yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And yet, do you know, I think she has
lately suffered a shock and a disappointment?
I am nearly certain that she had cherished
hopes which included us both. I did not
realize until very lately indeed that she too
was being deceived; else I must have insisted
on her being taken into confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alice&#39;s merry laugh astonished and almost
vexed him, her first words were more surprising
still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you thought she was disappointed?
What bats men are, to be sure!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean? Do you not know
that to my mother you are the one young
woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, indeed I do, and rejoice in it. But I
know also, my dear simpleton, that she is almost
deliriously happy at this moment over her late
discovery. I know she loves me almost as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
could a daughter, and I also know that she loves
me more, oh, far more, because her son Erskine
is a brother to me instead of&mdash;something else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His puzzled look made her laugh again.</p>

<p class="indent">But after that he studied his mother from a
new standpoint. Certainly she was very fond
of Alice and was about to lose her; yet certainly
she was happy&mdash;happier than he had
ever known her to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mothers are queer!&quot; was his grave conclusion.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p class="h3">A SPOILED MOTHER</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> had been an ideal October day: one of
those ravishing days that come sometimes
in late autumn when, though the air is crisp
with the hint of a coming winter, it is at the same
time balmy with the memory of the departed
summer. The hills in the near distance had put
on their glorified autumn dress, and the flowers
in the gardens were all of the gorgeous or deep-toned
colorings that tell of summer suns and
autumn crispness. It was, in short, one of those
days when it is, or should be, a delight simply to
live.</p>

<p class="indent">The Burnham place had never looked more
lovely than it did that afternoon, bathed in the
soft glory of an unusually brilliant sun-setting.
It was customary to speak of this as the old
Burnham place; yet nothing in Ruth Erskine
Burnham&#39;s changeful life showed more markedly
the effect of change than did this.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
The long, low, rambling, old-fashioned house,
much in need of paint, that Ruth had come to as
a bride, was there still, but so altered that even
she had all but forgotten the original. The
house and the grounds had been, like many other
things and persons, transformed. No spot
anywhere, for miles around, was such a source
of pride and pleasure to the old friends of that
region as the Burnham place. There were
those still living who could tell in minutest
detail the story of its transformation, when the
Judge&#39;s new wife came out there to live, and
astonished the country by her doings. Some of
them had been more than half afraid of Ruth in
those early days; they all believed in her now.</p>

<p class="indent">She had come out to the upper porch for a
moment, not so much to get a view of the wonderful
sunset as to get her breath. The house
was full of flowers, and they had seemed to
stifle her.</p>

<p class="indent">A handsome woman still was Mrs. Burnham.
Stately was one of the words that people had
been wont to use in describing her; she was
stately yet, though her son Erskine would soon
celebrate his thirtieth birthday.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
These later years had touched her lightly.
They had been spent, for the most part, in the
cheerful quiet of their old home, which, although
the city had grown out to it, had yet not absorbed
it, but allowed its favored residents to have
much of the pleasures of country life, with a
rapid transit into the heart of the great city as
often as life of that kind was desired.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine had for several years been admitted
to the bar, and the old firm name that had meant
so much in legal circles had once more the
strong name of Burnham associated with it.
That her son was a legal success was not a surprise
to his mother. With such antecedents as
his how could it have been otherwise? She had
not kept up with his legal studies as she had
almost done through his college course, but she
had kept in touch with them, and could copy
his notes for him, giving him just the points
he needed&mdash;better, he told her, than he could
do it himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will take you into the firm if you say so,
dearest,&quot; he said gayly one evening, after a
spirited argument between them with regard to
a point of law in which Mrs. Burnham had vindicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
her side by an appeal to an undoubted
authority. &quot;I told Judge Hallowell, yesterday,
that it was easier to consult you than to look
up a point, and did just as well. He would
agree to the partnership, mother, without
hesitation; he considers you a wonderful
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At which the happy mother laughed, and told
him he was a wonderful flatterer; and then&mdash;Did
he want her to look up the evidence in that
Brainard case for him? She could do it as well
as not. She had been reading up about it that
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">An ideal life they had lived together all these
years, this mother and son. More than once in
the years gone by Mrs. Burnham had overheard
some such remark as: &quot;It will be hard on that
mother when Erskine marries, will it not?&quot; It
used to annoy her a little. She was conscious
of a feeling very like resentment that people
should consider it necessary to discuss their
affairs at all; especially to intimate that there
would ever be anything &quot;hard&quot; between them.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been other talk, too, that she had
resented. It had been noticed that Judge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
Hallowell, Judge Burnham&#39;s lifelong friend,
came often to the old Burnham place, and somebody
got up a very sentimental reason for his
never having married; and somebody else objected
that Mrs. Burnham did not believe in
second marriages; she had been heard to go so
far as to say she thought they were actually
wrong. Then somebody else looked wise and
smiled, and said she had heard of people, before
this, who changed their opinions about such
things, on occasion. And&mdash; How would such
a masterful young man as Erskine get on with a
stepfather? This bit of gossip had floated about
the Burnhams for a year or more, while Erskine
was studying law, without their having been the
wiser for it. The day for the wedding had almost
been set, still without reference to them, when
Judge Hallowell, sixty years old though he was,
suddenly brought home a wife; and that, without
an hour&#39;s break in the friendship between
himself and the Burnhams.</p>

<p class="indent">By degrees, the form of the question which the
talkers asked each other slightly changed, and
they said they were afraid it would be hard on
Mrs. Burnham if Erskine should ever marry, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
they added that it wasn&#39;t probable that he ever
would. They even ventured, one or two of
the more intimate, or the more rude, to express
some such thought to the mother herself. When
they did, she laughed lightly and bade them
not be sure of anything. Her son might astonish
them all, yet. She was sure she hoped so.
She was sincere in this. As each year passed
she told herself more and more firmly that of
course she wanted him to marry. Why shouldn&#39;t
she want him to find that lovely being who must
have been foreordained for him? She was sure
now, after all her long years of experience with
him, that she should know the very first moment
when he discovered her. Of course she
had not been through the years since Alice
Warder was married without more than once
imagining that she had been discovered. They
had numbered some very lovely young women
among their friends. There had been a certain
Miriam whom she had admired and liked and
almost loved, and had meant to love in earnest
if Erskine really wished it. And she had gone
about the finding out very cautiously. Didn&#39;t
he think Miriam was pretty?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&quot;Very pretty indeed,&quot; he had answered
promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">And she was so sweet and winsome, so thoughtful
of her elders, so gracious to everybody; quite
unlike many others in that respect.</p>

<p class="indent">He was quick to agree with this, also.</p>

<p class="indent">Didn&#39;t he think her delightful in conversation?
She seemed able to converse sensibly on any
subject that was under discussion, as well as
to talk the most delicious nonsense, on occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he said cheerfully. In that respect
he must differ from her. He could not say he
thought the young woman especially gifted in
conversation; it seemed to him to be her
weak point. If she could talk as well as her
grandmother, she would be charming.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham had argued loyally for her
favorite; had assured her son that Miriam was
a charming talker when she chose, and that it
was ridiculous to think of comparing her with
her grandmother! But she had laughed light-heartedly
at his folly, and had confessed to her
secret self that she was glad he liked the grandmother
better.</p>

<p class="indent">There were several other temporary interests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
and then the mother settled down to restfulness.
Erskine was a boy no longer, but a full-grown
man, doing a man&#39;s work in the world; she
could trust him. He had always confided in her
and of course he would not fail to do so when this
supreme hour of his life came to him. She still
wanted him to marry; she believed that he
would, some day. She promised herself that
she would be, when the time came, a perfect
mother. She would love the chosen one with all
her heart; she should be second only to Erskine
himself. And she would give herself to helping
them both to be so happy, anticipating their
wishes and aiding and abetting all their plans,
that they would be glad to have her with them
always. And always she closed these hours of
planning with a long-drawn sigh of satisfaction
that they were all in the dim future.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine Burnham had passed his thirtieth
birthday before he had been separated from his
mother for more than a few days at a time. It
was early in the May following the thirtieth
anniversary when the break came. He went
abroad then, on legal business of importance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall you take your mother over with you?&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
Judge Hallowell had asked, but a short time
before he started; and he had answered quickly:
&quot;Oh, yes, indeed; I couldn&#39;t think of leaving
mother alone, with the ocean between us; she
is too much accustomed to my daily care for
that. Moreover, I think a sea voyage will be
good for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But his mother met him at the door, that
afternoon, open letter in hand, and the grave
announcement that she had bad news for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, dearest?&quot; he had asked composedly,
as he bent to kiss her. It occurred to him
then there could be no very bad news for either
of them so long as they stood there together,
safe and well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Alice; she is ill, very ill they are afraid,
and her husband writes that she wants me immediately.
They think, Erskine, that there will
have to be an operation, and she feels that she
cannot go through it without me. I fill the
place of mother to her, you know, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine did not take his disappointment easily.
He was used to having his own way, and he had
planned a delightful outing for his mother. He
argued the question strenuously, and was loath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
to admit that his mother&#39;s duty lay elsewhere,
and that he must go abroad without her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is hard on my mother,&quot; he said discontentedly
to Judge Hallowell. But he admitted
to himself that it was quite as hard for him; he
hated travelling alone.</p>

<p class="indent">For Mrs. Burnham the summer had dragged.
For thirty years she had lived for her son. Why
should life without him be called living? It was
harder for her because her sacrifice proved to be
unnecessary. The surgical operation was, after
all, postponed; there was some hope that it
would not have to be at all; and Alice herself
had gone abroad with her husband: not by
Erskine&#39;s route, but on a sailing vessel, making
the ocean trip as long as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham had stayed to do the thousand
and one little things for the invalid that a mother
would naturally do, and to see her fairly started
on her journey, and then had come back to her
lonely home: what might-have-been crowding
itself discontentedly among her thoughts. She
had lost her summer with Erskine for nothing,
she told herself. Still, the summer was going;
it would not be long now.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
Erskine had written to her daily, mailing his
letters as opportunity offered. At first the
letters were long, very long and full; it was
almost like seeing the old world with him.
Then, as business matters pressed him, and
social functions growing out of business relations
consumed more and more of his time, they shortened,
often to a few hurried lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes there was only the date at a late
hour, and &quot;Good night, mother dear. This has
been my &#39;busy day.&#39; Interesting things have
happened. Heaps to tell you when I get home,
which I hope now will be soon. Perhaps in my
very next I can set the date.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had lived on his letters, watching for each
as eagerly as a maiden might watch for word from
her lover. Was he not her lover? All she had
in all the world, she told herself proudly, and
was satisfied, and smiled over that word,
&quot;Dearest,&quot; that fell as naturally from his pen
as from his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">That next letter in which perhaps he would
set the date of his return was waited for in almost
feverish impatience. There was so much she
wanted to do just before he came. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
planned to set the house and grounds in festive
array as for the coming of a conqueror. Actually
his first home-coming of any note in which she
was there to greet him! Always before they
had come together.</p>

<p class="indent">The watched-for letter was delayed. There
occurred a longer interval by several days than
there had been before, between letters. Mrs.
Burnham allowed herself to grow almost nervous
over this, and watched the newspapers hourly,
glancing over foreign items in feverish haste.
She talked about the strangeness of this delay
with her friends, until the most sympathetic
among them laughed a little and told each other
that that spoiled mother was really absurd!
And at last it came.</p>

<p class="indent">She remembered&mdash;she will always remember
that October evening when, the shades being
drawn close and a brisk fire burning in the grate,
she had seated herself near it in a luxurious reading
chair and, merely for company, had pushed
Erskine&#39;s favorite easy-chair just opposite and
laughed a little at her folly, and tried to assure
herself that young Ben had returned long ago
with the evening mail, which had to be sent for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
if one could not wait until morning. And then&mdash;Ben&#39;s
step had crunched on the gravel outside,
and she had held her breath to listen, and&mdash;in
another minute it lay in her lap! A thick
letter, when she had expected only a few hurried
lines. It was almost like the steamer letter
that he had written her on going out. It
couldn&#39;t be a steamer letter! not yet! She
seized it eagerly and studied the postmark.
Could he be coming so soon that this was really
her last letter?</p>

<p class="indent">How silly she was! her hand trembled so that
the thin foreign paper rattled in her grasp.
There were many sheets written fine and full.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was not a steamer letter; he was still
in Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">She made herself wait until she gave careful
attention to Ellen, who appeared just then,
answering all her questions, directing her in
minute detail as to a piece of next morning&#39;s
work, having her add another block to the
fire and rearrange the windows before she finally
dismissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she was fairly into her letter. She
read rapidly at first, devouring the pages with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
her eyes. Then, more slowly, stopping over
one page, re-reading it, a third, a fourth time;
staring at it, with a strange look in her eyes.
Suddenly she dropped them, all the thin rustling
sheets, and covered her face with both hands.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to her afterward that she spent a
lifetime shut up with that foreign letter.</p>

<h2><a name="chIX" id="chIX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p class="h3">SENTIMENT AND SACRIFICE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> woman on the upper porch who had
come out to get her breath had in a short
time passed through so many phases of feeling
as to be hardly able to recognize herself. She
had lived ten days since that bulky foreign letter
had seemed to change the current of her life
and set it flowing&mdash;when indeed it flowed
again&mdash;in another channel.</p>

<p class="indent">In truth, Ruth Erskine Burnham, as she
stood there ostensibly watching the sunset, was
reviewing the days in a half-frightened, half-shamefaced
way. She had always, even in young
girlhood, been self-controlled. Why could she
not hold herself in better check even though her
world had suddenly turned to&mdash;stop! she would
not say it! What had happened to her, after
all, but that which fell to the lot of mothers?
It was not as though some terrible calamity had
overtaken her, and yet&mdash;could she have done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
differently if it had been? She went back in
thought to that evening ten days away and looked
at herself as though she were another person
looking on. She even smiled faintly at the
absurdity of that foolish woman&#39;s first action,
before she had finished reading the letter. She
had risen suddenly and turned off the light, and
pushed up every window to its highest, and rolled
back the curtains and let in a whirl of wind that
had made the foreign sheets fly about as though
they were things of life. Then, aided only by
the firelight, she had stooped and clutched after
them and held them for a second to her breast
and then, suddenly, had thrown them from her
with a low cry of pain. The woman on the upper
porch looking at the sunset smiled at that half-insane
woman of ten days ago and wondered
that she could have so far forgotten herself.
Why should there have been any such outburst
as that, when Erskine was well and&mdash;and happy.
She shivered a little even now over the word,
and drew her wrap closer and told herself that
as soon as the sun disappeared the chill came.
Then she went back to her review and reminded
herself firmly that there had been no calamity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
to any one; there was nothing but joy. Erskine
was not only well and happy, but he was coming
home. He was coming to-night! No, she must
not say &quot;he&quot; any more; <i>they</i> were coming.
Forever and ever after this it must be &quot;they&quot;:
her son and daughter. That to which she had
looked forward for so many years with varying
emotions had come upon her. Erskine was a
married man; and to-night he was bringing home
his bride. She had said over the words aloud,
that day, when she was quite alone, trying to
make herself feel that she was speaking of her
son. It was all so sudden, so utterly different
from any imaginings of hers, and she thought
that she had gone over in her imaginings the
whole wide range of possibilities.</p>

<p class="indent">That long letter over which she had spent a
strange night, believed that it was giving her
the minutest particulars of this strange thing.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine had met the woman who was now his
wife on his first evening in Paris, and from the
very first had been attracted to her by his sympathy
with her unprotected condition. Her
only friend and companion in a strange land
was a maiden aunt who was an invalid. Indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
it was for her sake that they were lingering
in France, because she was not able to
travel; she had been made worse by the ocean
voyage, instead of better as had been hoped.
Irene had been very closely confined with her
for many weeks, and welcomed a face and voice
from home as only those can understand who
have themselves been cast adrift among foreigners.
He had been able to do a few little things
for the comfort of the invalid, and the gratitude
of both ladies was almost embarrassing. They
were staying at the same hotel, and as they
chanced at that time to be almost the only Americans,
at least the only ones belonging to their
world, they naturally saw much of each other.
As the aunt grew more and more feeble and Irene
became entirely dependent on him not only for
what little rest and recreation she got, but for
all those offices which members of the same
family can do for each other in a time of illness,
their friendship made rapid strides. Then,
when her aunt was suddenly taken alarmingly
ill, and after a few days of really terrible suffering
died, leaving Irene alone in a strange land,
her situation was pitiable. He would have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
confess that he did not know just what she
would have done, had he not been there to care
for her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, mother, you do not need to have
me tell you that long before this I knew that I
had met the one woman in all the world who
could ever become my wife. The reason that I
had not mentioned her in any of my letters was
that I could not, even on paper, speak of her
casually, as of any ordinary acquaintance, and
I had no right to speak in any other way. Then,
when I had the right to tell you everything, it
was so near my home-coming that I determined
to leave it until you and I were face to face, and
I could answer all your questions and look into
your dear eyes and receive from you the sympathy
that has never failed me and I know
never will. Nothing was farther from our
thoughts at that time than immediate marriage.
Indeed it would have seemed preposterous to
me, as it would have been under any other
circumstances, to be married without your
knowledge and presence. But when this unexpected
blow came, I realized the almost
impossibility of any other course, although,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
even then, I had the greatest difficulty in persuading
Irene to take such a step. She had to
be convinced through some annoying experiences
of the folly of her hesitation. I do not
know that even you, with your long experience,
realize the difference between this country and
ours in matters of etiquette. Things which at
home would be done as a matter-of-course are
so unusual here as to be almost, if not quite,
questionable; and the number of purely business
details that loomed up to be managed by
that lonely homesick girl simply appalled her.
She sank under them, physically, and I plainly
saw that she simply must have my help and
care day and night. Why, even the nurse who
had attended her aunt, deserted us! that is, she
was summoned away by telegraph. In short,
mamma, there was literally no other course for
us than the one we took; although it had to be
taken at the sacrifice of a good deal of sentiment
on the part of both. It is a continual relief to me
to remember that I am writing to a sane and
reasonable woman, who is in the habit of weighing
questions carefully, and who, when she
decides that a thing is right, does it without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
regard to sentiment or adverse opinion. But
oh, mommie, it was hard not to have you with
us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was more in the letter, much more.
Erskine had exhausted language and repeated
himself again and again in his effort to make
everything very clear and convincing.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been skilful also in his attempt to
make his mother see the woman of his choice
with his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will appeal to your sympathies,
mamma,&quot; he had written. &quot;Although she is so
young, barely twenty-six, she has been through
much trouble and sorrow. She is an orphan,
and has been for four years a widow. I need
hardly add that her short married life was
unhappy and so sad that she can scarcely speak
of that year even to me. Of course it is an
experience that I shall do my utmost to make
her forget; and I need not speak of it again. I
wanted you to know, dear mother, that you and
I have much to make up to her. She was made
fatherless and motherless in a single day, when
she was a child of sixteen. I like to think of
what you will be to her, dearest mother; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
revelation, I am sure, of mother-love; for besides
being so young when she lost hers, there
are mothers, and <i>mothers</i>, you know, and I am
sure Irene does not understand it very well;
Do you know, she is half afraid of you? She
has read a few of your letters, and has caught
an idea of what we are to each other, and talks
mournfully about coming between us! as
though any one ever could! I have assured
her that I am simply bringing to you the daughter
for whom your heart has always longed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was at that point that Ruth Burnham had
flung the sheets away from her and buried her
face in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">But ten days had passed since then, and she
had long known, by heart, all that that letter
could tell her.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, in less than another hour, they
would be at home! her son and daughter!</p>

<p class="indent">She had not gone to New York to meet the
incoming steamer, as had been arranged, or
rather, as it had once arranged itself, quite as a
matter of course.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think how delightful it will be, when you
stand on the dock watching the incoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
steamer, and straining your eyes to discover
which frantically waved handkerchief is mine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was what Erskine had said as he gave
her one of her good-by kisses.</p>

<p class="indent">She had replied that she would recognize his
handkerchief among a thousand.</p>

<p class="indent">In the earlier letters much had been said
about that home-coming, and elaborate plans
had been made as to what they would do together
in New York. But in that last long
letter, on the margin of the last page, as
though it had been an afterthought, were these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the whole, mother, we believe that it
would be better for you not to try to meet us
in New York. Irene has no love for that city;
it was the scene of some of her sorrows. She
wants to stop there only long enough to call
upon her cousins; and we are both in such
frantic haste to be at home that we shall make
the delay as short as possible; so we think it
would be less fatiguing to you to avoid that
trip and be at home to welcome us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Burnham said over that sentence as
she stood on that upper veranda, waiting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
welcome them. She had said it a hundred
times before. What was there about it that
jarred? She could not have told, in words;
yet the jar was there.</p>

<p class="indent">Could it be that continually recurring &quot;we&quot;?
Was she going to be a jealous woman, with all
the rest? So meanly jealous as that? &quot;God
forbid!&quot; she said the words aloud, and solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that she needed the help of God in
this crisis of her life; since the news of it came
to her she had spent hours on her knees seeking
his strength. She wanted Erskine to say &quot;we&quot;
and think &quot;we&quot; and to be supremely happy,&mdash;not
only in his married life, but to have
that life all that it could be to two souls. And
yet&mdash;Would it have been wrong for him, in
that first letter, to have remembered that she
had been used all his life to being the &quot;we&quot; of
his thoughts, and to have said simply &quot;I&quot; once
or twice? Of course she could never any more
be &quot;dearest&quot;&mdash;his special name for her; but&mdash;was
he never again for a little while to be just
himself, to her? And must she learn to think
&quot;they&quot; and never &quot;him&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
Oh, she didn&#39;t mean any of this, she told herself
nervously, and she must get her thoughts
away at once. Of course she would say &quot;Erskine
and Irene&quot; now, always, and forever.
Or should she put it, &quot;Irene and Erskine&quot;?
Could she? Perhaps that would help. Did
other mothers, waiting for the home-coming of
their married sons, have such strange thoughts
as haunted her?</p>

<p class="indent">There was Mrs. Adams, for instance, whose
three sons had all been married within a few
years. And Mrs. Adams had not seemed to
care. Well, as to that, neither would she seem
to; and she drew herself up instinctively.
But Mrs. Adams had four boys; five, indeed;
the youngest of them was almost as tall as his
mother, while she&mdash;&quot;The only son of his
mother, and she was a widow.&quot; The words
seemed to repeat themselves in her brain like a
dull undertone refrain.</p>

<p class="indent">Other words that had nothing whatever to do
with the situation, but that had been familiar to
her girlhood, came back and stupidly repeated
themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dead! One of them shot by the sea in the east.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
But that was wildness, and utter folly!
Erskine would be ashamed of her and with
reason, could he know&mdash;which he never
should&mdash;that such fancies had been tolerated
for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Outwardly Mrs. Burnham was irreproachable.
So was her home. In the ten days following
that letter she had given time and thought to
its adorning. She was a model housekeeper,
and to have Erskine&#39;s rooms always in spotless
order had been one of her pleasures. But they
had been very thoroughly gone over, and whereever
it was possible to add a touch of beauty, it
had been done.</p>

<p class="indent">Already she had drawn the shades and lighted
up brilliantly, for at this season the twilights
were very brief. She had paused, on her way
to the veranda, to take a final critical survey,
and had told herself that she did not know how
to make an added touch. And then she went
swiftly to her own room and brought therefrom
a vase of roses and set them on the dressing-table
of the bride. The vase was a costly
trifle that Erskine had brought her just before
he went abroad, and the roses were his special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
favorites. She had kept that vase filled with
them on her table ever since she reached home.</p>

<p class="indent">For herself, she was dressed in white: Erskine&#39;s
favorite home dress for her, summer and
winter. Indeed he was almost absurd about it,
never quite liking to see her in any other attire.
&quot;I suppose you will want me to dress in white
when I am eighty!&quot; she had said to him once,
laughingly. His reply had been quick. &quot;Of
course I shall. What could be more appropriate
for a beautiful old lady? You will be
beautiful, dearest, but I cannot think that you
will ever be old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So, on this evening, although she had taken
down a black silk and looked at it wistfully,
she had resolutely hung it away again, and
brought out a white cashmere richly trimmed
with white silk. This was a festive evening and
she must honor it with one of her prettiest
dresses.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once as she stood there, waiting, her
heart seemed for a moment to stop its beating.
She clutched at the railing to prevent her falling,
and made a stern and effectual protest. &quot;This
is ridiculous! I will not faint, and I shall do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
nothing to mar his home-coming, or to give him
occasion to be ashamed of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But she stood still, although the carriage that
had gone to the station to meet the bridal party
was whirling around the corner, was turning in
at the carriage drive, was stopping before the
door. They were getting out. They were on
the porch, they were in the hall; she could hear
her son&#39;s voice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is my mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And she was not there as she had meant to be
to welcome them! she was still on the upper
veranda, steadying herself by the railing and
feeling it impossible to take a single step.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chX" id="chX"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p class="h3">&quot;SENTIMENTAL&quot; PEOPLE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Erskine</span> came up the stairs in quick leaps.
&quot;Mother!&quot; he was calling. &quot;Mother!
Where are you? Why, mommie!&quot; and he had
her in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I should be sure to see you the
moment the carriage turned the corner! Are
you ill, mother? What is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Was there reproach in his voice? There was
something that gave back his mother&#39;s self-command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is tardiness,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;The
carriage came sooner than I had thought it
possible. O Erskine, it is good to hear your
voice again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He kept his arms about her and was half
smothering her in kisses while he talked. Yet
his tones had that note in them which held her
in check.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
&quot;Irene will think this a strange welcome home,
I am afraid; I had to leave her in the hall with
the maids while I came in search of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will go down at once,&quot; said his mother;
and she withdrew herself from his arms and led
the way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is very pretty.&quot; This was Mrs. Burnham&#39;s
mental tribute to her new daughter, as
they stood together on the side porch after
breakfast. It was the morning after the arrival
of the bride and groom. They had been drawn
thither by Erskine, who had walked back and
forth with an arm about each, bewailing the
fact that he could not spare even one day for
his wife in her new home, but must get at once
to business. In the midst of his regretful sentence
his car was heard at the crossing above,
and he had hurried away, calling back to them
to take care of themselves, and get well acquainted
while he was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">The two ladies had each returned a gay answer,
and then had watched their opportunity to
glance furtively at each other, uncertain how to
begin the formidable task set them.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Burnham had it in her heart to be almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
sorry for the younger woman, left thus without
Erskine to lean upon, her only companion in
this new, strange home, a woman to whom
the place had been home for a generation. Did
this give her a special advantage? Ought she
to do something to make the other woman feel
at home? What should it be? What ideas
had they in common? There was Erskine,
of course. It was not hard for the mother to
understand why this woman had been attracted
to him. How indeed could she help it? But
what was it in her that had won him?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is certainly very pretty,&quot; she said again,
as she studied the shapely figure leaning meditatively
against one of the porch pillars; she was
looking down into the garden gay with autumn
blooms.</p>

<p class="indent">She was rather above medium height, with a
fair skin and a wealth of golden brown hair
and eyes that were very blue. Ruth did not like
her eyes. That is, she would not have liked
them if they had not belonged to her daughter-in-law.
In the solitude of her strangely solitary
room, the night before, she had fought out again
one of her battles, and had resolved anew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
there should be nothing about this new daughter
that she would not like.</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly she was pretty; so was her dress.
She was all in white; not a touch of color anywhere.
Was that her taste, or Erskine&#39;s fancy?
Could his mother make it a stepping-stone to
conversation?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dressed for Erskine, this morning, I
fancy,&quot; she said with a winsome smile. &quot;I
presume you have already discovered how fond
he is of white?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, he has held forth to me on that subject.
Some of his ideas are absurd, but they
serve me very well just now. All white answers
as a substitute for mourning, under the circumstances.
I hate black, and I am glad that Erskine
did not want me to wear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was the first reference that had been made
to her bereavement. Mrs. Burnham had not
known how to touch it. Neither had her
daughter&#39;s words suggested what should be
said. She murmured some commonplace about
the peculiar hardness of the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; said the younger woman. &quot;It
was simply dreadful! Aunt Mary had been an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
invalid always,&mdash;ever since I knew her, at least,&mdash;but
nobody supposed that she would ever
die. She was one of the nervous kind, you know,
full of aches and pains; a fresh list each morning,
and a detailed description of each. I did get
so tired of it! If it hadn&#39;t been for Erskine, I
don&#39;t know what I should have done. Poor
auntie was very fond of him, and no wonder.
He bore with all her stories and her whims like a
hero. I used to tell him that he had not lived
with his mother all his life, for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her sudden death must have been a great
shock to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The new mother made a distinct effort to keep
her voice from sounding cold. Something in
the words or the tones of the younger woman
had jarred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes,&quot; she said, and sighed. &quot;You cannot
imagine what a perfectly dreadful time it was!
You know when people are always ill and always
fussing, you get used to it, and expect them to go
on forever. If I had had the least idea that she
was going to die, I should have planned differently,
of course. What I should have done without
Erskine, as things turned out, it makes me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
shudder to think. What a queer old place this
is, isn&#39;t it? Erskine tells me that he has always
lived here and that the garden looks much as it
did when he was a child. Is that so? It seems
so strange to me! I have moved about so much
that I cannot imagine how it would be to live
always, anywhere. I don&#39;t believe I should like
it. The everlasting sameness, you know, would
be such a bore. Don&#39;t you find it so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth tried to smile. &quot;I am very much attached
to the place. I came to it, as you have,
a bride; and now I am afraid I should have difficulty
in making any other place seem like home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that is because you are old. Poor
auntie was forever sighing for home. Nothing
in all France or Italy was at all to be compared
to the delights of her room at home with four
south windows and long curtains that she had
hemstitched herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed lightly and flitted away from the
subject.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that an oak tree over there by the south
gateway? Don&#39;t you think oaks are ugly?
They haven&#39;t the least bit of grace. I like elm
trees better than any other; every movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
of their limbs is graceful. There isn&#39;t one about
the place, is there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, indeed, the other entrance from the
east is lined with them the entire length of the
carriage drive. Was your aunt compelled to
remain abroad on account of the climate? It
seems sad to think that she had to be away from
her home when she missed it and mourned
for it.&quot; Ruth could not keep her thoughts from
reverting to the aunt who had been so large a part
of the younger woman&#39;s life for many years and
had been so recently removed from it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I suppose she could have lived at home.
In fact she was worse after leaving it, or thought
she was; I didn&#39;t see any great difference. It
was a lonesome, poky old house where she lived.
Older than this, and awfully dreary in winter.
I couldn&#39;t have stayed there a winter, after I
once got away, to have saved her life. It was
back in the country, you know, two miles from
town; think of it! I hate the country. Little
cities like this one are bad enough, but the country!
Deliver me from ever having to live in it
again. I thought I should die when I was there
as a girl.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
&quot;Is Erskine very much attached to this place,
do you suppose, or has he stayed here just for
your sake? I should think it would be much
better for him to live where his business is.
Think how much of his time is consumed in
going back and forth! and then, too, it is so disagreeable
for him to never be within call when
one wants him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to the length of time it takes to go back
and forth, that is no more than is taken by those
who live in the best residence portions of the
large city; we have rapid transit, and all the
business men who can afford to do so, keep their
homes out here. Erskine has never known any
other home than this, and it would be strange
indeed if he were not attached to it. Of course
it is associated with his father as no other place
can ever be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time it was not possible for the elder
lady to keep her voice from sounding cold and
constrained. The thought of Erskine in any
other home than this one that had been improved
from time to time and made beautiful, always
with his interests in view, had not so much as
occurred to her. She recoiled from the mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
suggestion, and also from the easy and careless
manner in which it was made.</p>

<p class="indent">The young woman&#39;s manner was still careless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, of course; but young people do not feel
such attachments much; it isn&#39;t natural. We
talk a great deal about sentimental youth, but
I think it is the old who are sentimental, don&#39;t
you? Auntie was an illustration of that. She
had the greatest quantity of old duds that she
carried about with her wherever she went, just
because they were keepsakes, souvenirs, and all
that sort of thing. They were of no real value,
you know, the most of them, and some were
mere rubbish. I had the greatest time when we
were packing to go abroad; she wanted to lug
ever so much of that stuff with her! I just had
to set my foot down that it couldn&#39;t be done;
and it was fortunate that I did, as things turned
out. We had a horrid time getting packed; if
Erskine had had all that rubbish to see to with
the rest, I don&#39;t know what would have become
of him. I don&#39;t believe he has sentimental
notions; he is too sensible. He ought to be in
the city; that is the place for a man to rise; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
you want him to rise, don&#39;t you? Aren&#39;t you
ambitious for him? I am. I want him to stand
at the very head of his profession. I tell him
that if he doesn&#39;t, it will not be for lack of brains,
but on account of a morbid conscience. Don&#39;t
you think he is inclined to be over-conscientious,
sometimes? What an odd, old-fashioned plant
that is beyond the rose arbor; it looks like a
weed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had a curious fashion of mixing the important
and the trivial in a single sentence. The
mother, whose nerves quivered with her desire
to answer that remark about over-conscientiousness,
restrained herself and explained the plant
that looked like a weed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a very choice variety of begonia and has
a lovely blossom in its season. It is the first
thing that Erskine planted quite by himself.
He was a tiny boy then, with yellow curls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s voice trembled. A vision of her
boy in his childish beauty, in the long-ago days
when he was all her own, came back to her,
bringing with it a strange new pang.</p>

<p class="indent">The wife laughed carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you have kept it all these years, ugly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
it is, on that account? I told you it was old
people who were sentimental.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham turned abruptly away, murmuring
something about household duties. She
went to the kitchen and gave the cook some
directions that she did not need; then went
swiftly to her room and closed and locked her
door. Then she passed through to her sitting
room, the door of which was opposite her son&#39;s,
and stood always open, inviting his entrance, and
closed and locked it. She had a feeling that she
must be alone. More alone than closed and
locked doors would make her. She must shut
out something that had come in unawares and
taken hold of her life. But could she shut it
out, or get away from it?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must pray,&quot; she said aloud, clasping both
hands over her throbbing forehead. &quot;I must
pray a great deal. I am not alone; God is with
me; and nothing dreadful has happened, or is
about to happen. There is nothing and there
must be nothing but peace and joy in our
home. I must be quiet and sensible and not
sentimental. Oh, I must not be sentimental
at all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
She laughed a little over that word&mdash;the kind
of laugh that does not help one; but it was
followed immediately by tears, and they relieved
a little of the strain.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she went to her knees; and when she
arose, was quiet and ready for life. The thought
came to her that it was well that she was acquainted
with God and did not have to seek him
at this time as one unknown. He had kept his
everlasting arms underneath her through trying
years, certainly she could trust him now.</p>

<p class="indent">She went out at once in search of her daughter,
intending to propose a drive; but Ellen met her
in the hall with a message.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was to tell you, ma&#39;am, that young Mrs.
Burnham has gone to lie down and doesn&#39;t want
to be disturbed. She doesn&#39;t want to be awakened
even for luncheon; she says she has been
on a steady strain for weeks, and has a lot of
sleeping to make up; she shouldn&#39;t wonder if
she slept all day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, Ellen, we will keep the house
quiet and let her rest as long as she will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s voice was quietness itself, yet,
despite that phrase &quot;young Mrs. Burnham,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
which, some way, jarred, her heart was filled
with compunction. Had the poor young wife, a
stranger in a strange home, shut herself up to
sleep, or to cry? She had been through nerve-straining
experiences so recently; death and
marriage coming into one short week; and now,
a new home, and Erskine away for the day, and
no one within sight or sound whom she had ever
seen before. Would it be any wonder if the
tears wanted to come? Could not her new
mother have helped her through this first strange
day? Why had she not put tender arms about
her and kissed her, and called her &quot;daughter,&quot;
and said how glad she was to have a daughter?
That was what she had meant to do. This
morning when she came from her night vigil, she
had almost the words on her lips that she meant
to say as soon as they two were alone. She had
meant the words in their fulness; so at least
she believed. They had come to her in answer
to her cry for help. What had kept her from
saying them?</p>

<p class="indent">Even while she asked herself the question, a
faint weary smile hovered about her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Had she done so, would she have been thought
&quot;sentimental?&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXI" id="chXI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p class="h3">&quot;PLANS FOR A PURPOSE&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Burnhams were still seated at their
dinner table, although Mrs. Erskine Burnham
had just remarked that the evening was
too lovely to spend in eating.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us take a walk on the porch in the
moonlight the minute we are through dinner,&quot;
she said to her husband. Apparently she paid
no heed to the slight dry cough which came so
frequently from Erskine that his mother&#39;s face
took on a shade of anxiety. Erskine&#39;s coughs
had been his mother&#39;s chief anxiety concerning
him through the years; he had never been able
to tamper with them; but his wife laughed at
her fears and frankly told her that Erskine was
too old now to be coddled.</p>

<p class="indent">To all outward appearances the Burnham
dining room was exhibiting a perfect home scene.
The day had been balmy, with a hint of summer
in the air, and although the evening was cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
enough for a bright fire in the grate, the mantle
above it had been banked with violets, whose
sweet spring breath pervaded the air.</p>

<p class="indent">To Erskine Burnham who had been all day
in the rush and roar of the great city, the lovely
room with its flower-laden air, and its daintily
appointed dinner table with the two ladies
seated thereat in careful toilets, formed a picture
of complete and restful home life. He glanced
from wife to mother with eyes of approval and
spoke joyously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you two can fully appreciate
what it is to me to get home to you after a stuffy,
snarly day in town. I sit in the car sometimes
with closed eyes after a day of turmoil, to picture
how it will all look. But the reality always
exceeds my imagination.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His wife laughed gayly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is because you come home hungry,&quot; she
said. &quot;You want your dinner and you like the
odor of it and make believe that it is sentiment
and violets. In reality it is roast beef and jelly
that charm you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He echoed her laugh. He thought her gay
spirits were charming. &quot;The roast beef helps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
undoubtedly,&quot; he said. &quot;Though it was violets
I noticed first, to-night. Aren&#39;t they lovely?
Did you arrange them, Irene? Hasn&#39;t it been
a perfect day? Too pleasant for staying in
doors patiently. I hope you have both been out
a great deal? Oh, it is Friday, isn&#39;t it? Then
you have, mamma, of course. What have
you been about, Irene?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I went to the lake this morning with the
Bensons; and we spent an hour or more with
the Langhams; they are here for a month.
It is lovely out there, Erskine, and there are
some charming cottages for rent. Two simply
ideal ones, either of which would suit us. Darling
little bird&#39;s-nests of cottages, not a great
staring room in one of them. I wish we could
go there for the summer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine laughed indulgently, but at the
same time shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too far away, dear. I couldn&#39;t get out there
at night until seven, or later. Besides, you
wouldn&#39;t find it so pleasant as you fancy. Life
in one of those bird&#39;s-nest cottages is ideal only
on paper. Nothing could be pleasanter, I am
sure, than our own home; and it is a delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
drive to the lake whenever we want to go there.
So the Langhams are down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, and came to lunch with me. You
should see Harry! he has shaved his mustache,
and it changes his face so that I hardly knew
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Harry is here, is he? His face could
bear changing. What did you think of him,
mamma? He is the young man of whom I
wrote you, who went over on the same steamer
that I did, last spring.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before Mrs. Burnham could reply, his wife&#39;s
voice chimed in. &quot;She didn&#39;t meet him. I
went off with a rush, this morning. I heard
through the mail that the Langhams were down,
and I was in such a hurry to see Nettie that I
thought of nothing else. I ran away, don&#39;t you
think! Never said where I was going, or anything;
and then came back to luncheon so late
that I supposed of course mother had lunched
long before, and was lying down, so I wouldn&#39;t
have her disturbed. And don&#39;t you think she
had waited, and so lost her luncheon altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine laughed genially and waited to hear
his mother say that of course that was of no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
consequence; but she did not speak. The
cheerful voice of his wife went on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nettie Langham has the sweetest little home,
Erskine. If you could see it, you would never
say again that cottages were only nice on paper.
I&#39;m sure I long to prove to you how perfectly
charming one could be. And we have such a
host of pretty things that would fit into it.
Will Langham says he saves ten minutes night
and morning by being at that end of the town
instead of this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine chose to ignore the cottage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had an afternoon of calls, had you not?
I met the Emersons and the Stuarts down town
and both spoke of having been here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, they were here, with the Needham
girls; and Mrs. Easton and her daughter
Faye were here. We met them in New York,
you know. And oh, don&#39;t you think, Mrs.
Janeway&#39;s niece that we used to hear so much
about called this afternoon with a letter of introduction
from Mrs. Janeway. She is lovely,
Erskine. I was prepared to dislike her because
we heard such perfection of her; but really she
is charming. And she is going to be at one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
the lake cottages for several weeks; that is
another reason for our being out there, you see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed bent on holding his attention, but
Erskine turned to his mother with a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, don&#39;t you think Mrs. Stuart is
looking ill? I was shocked at the change in her.
Isn&#39;t it marked, or is it because I haven&#39;t seen
her lately?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not see her to-day, my son. I did
not even know she had been here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Erskine Burnham pretended to frown at
her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a stupid boy you can be when you
choose!&quot; she said. &quot;How many times must
I tell you that I thought mother was resting,
this afternoon, and did not disturb her with
callers? I&#39;m sure the Stuarts are not such infrequent
guests that one must make a special
effort to meet them. I&#39;ll tell you some other
people who were here. The Hemingways, don&#39;t
you think! The last time we saw them was
just as we were leaving Paris. They came back
only last month, and Mrs. Hemingway says
she is already homesick for Paris. That is
the worst of living abroad for a time; one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
is never afterward quite satisfied with this
country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma,&quot; said Erskine. &quot;Do I understand
that you have not been out, to-day, Friday,
though it is? Aren&#39;t you feeling well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was tender solicitude in his tones, but
his mother&#39;s voice was cold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite well, Erskine. May I give you some
coffee?&quot; This he declined, and almost immediately
his wife made a movement to leave the
table. She linked her arm at once in her husband&#39;s
and drew him toward the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come out on the porch, Erskine, do; this
room is stuffy to-night. One can&#39;t breathe in a
house with a fire, on such charming days as
these. Why, of course, it&#39;s prudent. The air
is as mild as it is in midsummer. Don&#39;t go to
housing yourself up because you have a tiny
little cold; it is the best way in the world to
make it cling. Dear me! don&#39;t I know all
about that? Poor auntie was forever hunting
about for draughts, and closing doors and windows
and putting shawls on herself and everybody
else. If I had to stay in the house with
another invalid of that kind, I should die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
They were on the porch by this time; she had
overcome Erskine&#39;s half-reluctance and had
closed the door behind them. But the window
was open and the mother could distinctly hear
the slight dry cough, more frequent now that
they were in the open air. She stood irresolute
for a moment, then turned and went swiftly
up to her own rooms and closed and locked her
door. Then she went hurriedly to the front
windows and drew the curtains close; she had
a feeling that she must shut out the outside world
very carefully. But she had no tears to shed;
on the contrary her eyes were very dry and
bright and seemed almost to burn in their sockets,
and two red spots glowed on her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a little more than six months since that
October evening when Erskine Burnham had
brought home his bride, and they had been
months of revelation to his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">During that time she had tried&mdash;did any
woman ever try harder?&mdash;to be, in the true sense
of the word, a mother to her daughter-in-law.
Her son&#39;s appeal during their first moments of
privacy had touched her deeply. He had ignored
any necessity for a further explanation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
his sudden marriage, accepting it as a matter of
course that his mother would fully appreciate
the simple statement that, however hard it was
for all three, it seemed to be the only right solution
of their difficulties; and went straight to
his point.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to be a revelation to Irene,
mommie. She knows very little about mother-love,
having had chiefly to imagine it, with,
I fancy, rather poor models on which to build her
imaginings. She is singularly alone in the world,
and she doesn&#39;t make close friends easily. It is
a joy to me to think how a part of her nature
that has heretofore been starved and dwarfed
will blossom out under your love and care.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then his mother had kissed him, a long, clinging,
self-surrendering kiss, while she vowed to
her secret soul never to disappoint his hopes.
What had she not done and left undone and
endured during those six months in order to
try to keep that vow! What an impossible
vow it was! How utterly Erskine had misunderstood
his wife in supposing that she wanted to
be loved by his mother! that she wanted anything
whatever of his mother except to efface her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
By slow degrees Mrs. Burnham was reaching
the conclusion that such was the policy of her
daughter-in-law. It had come to her as a surprise.
Whatever else in her checkered life Ruth
Erskine Burnham had been called upon to bear,
she had been accustomed to being recognized
always as an important force. Mrs. Erskine
Burnham had not planned in that way. She
did not argue, she never openly combated any
thing; she simply carried out her own intentions
without the slightest regard to the plans or the
convenience of others; or at least of one other.</p>

<p class="indent">From the first of her coming into this hitherto
ideal home she had assumed that her mother-in-law
was a feeble old woman on whom the claims
of society were irksome, and the ordering of
her home and servants a bore. At first, Ruth,
with her utterly different experience from which
to judge, did not understand the situation.
When her new daughter assured her that it was
too windy or too damp or too chilly or too warm
for her to expose herself, she laughed amusedly
and explained that she was in excellent health
and was accustomed to going out in all weather.
When callers came and went without her being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
notified, she attributed it at first to forgetfulness,
on the part of a bride, or to her ignorance of the
customs of the neighborhood; then to her over-solicitude
for an older woman&#39;s comfort, then
to carelessness, pure and simple, and finally,
by closely contested steps, to the conviction that
it was a deeply laid, steadily carried-out plan,
for a purpose. This day, at the close of which
she had locked herself into her room and vainly
tried to shut out the sounds of laughter on the
porch below, had given her abundant proof of
the truth of this conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Friday, the day which, ever since
Erskine was graduated and they were permanently
settled in their home, she had devoted
to making a round of calls upon people who had
been long ill, or who for any special reason needed
special thought. She took one or another of
them for a drive, she did errands for certain
others, she carried flowers and fruit and reading
matter to such as could enjoy them; in short
she gave herself and her carriage and horses in
any way that could best meet the interests of
those set apart. So much a feature of their life
had this morning programme become that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
Erskine was in the habit of referring to it much
as he did to Sunday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must not plan for guests at luncheon on
Fridays, Irene; mamma is much too tired for
social functions after her strenuous mornings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We could not have the carriage for that day,
dear; it is Friday, you remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Numberless times since the advent of the new
member of the family, had such reference to
the special custom been made; the mother&#39;s
eyes being now opened, she recalled instance
after instance in which there had been in progress
some pet scheme for Friday, that would interfere
with her disposal of it. More than once
she had tried to enter a protest; had urged that
she could wait until another day, or she could
order a carriage from the livery for that time;
but Erskine&#39;s negative had been prompt and
emphatic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed, mamma; we don&#39;t want you
to do anything of the kind. We are interested
in the Friday programme, too, remember. I
consider it almost in the light of a trust. Why,
the very horses would be hurt, Irene, if they
were not allowed to go their Friday rounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
carrying roses, and jellies, and balm. Nothing
not absolutely necessary, mommie, must be permitted
to interfere with that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet, on that Friday morning when Mrs. Burnham,
having studied the barometer and the sky,
had sent word to an especially delicate invalid
that she believed she could safely take a drive,
and had come down at the appointed hour
dressed for driving, with a couch pillow in hand
and an extra wrap over her arm, Ellen had met
her at the foot of the stairs with a flushed face
and eyes that had dropped their glance to the
floor for very shame, as she said: &quot;The carriage
has gone, ma&#39;am; I was coming to ask you if I
should &#39;phone for another, right away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gone!&quot; echoed her mistress, standing still
on the third step, and staring at the girl.
&quot;What do you mean, Ellen? Gone where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the station, ma&#39;am. Jonas said Mrs.
Erskine had ordered him to take her there to
meet a friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Mrs. Burnham, reaching for her
watch. &quot;Some guest just heard from who
must be met, I presume. Then they will be
back very soon, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Again the maid&#39;s indignant eyes drooped as
though unwilling to see her mistress&#39;s discomfiture
as she hurried her story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess not, ma&#39;am. She ordered luncheon
to be late; not earlier than two or half past, and
said there would be company; two anyway,
perhaps more. Will I &#39;phone for a carriage,
ma&#39;am?&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXII" id="chXII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p class="h3">ACCIDENT OR DESIGN?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> Burnham had stood for a full
minute irresolute; then she had spoken
in her usual tone, explaining to Ellen that the
friend she had intended to take out would not
be able to go in a livery carriage. She would
herself make plain to her why the drive must
be deferred until another time. The mistake
had occurred by her neglecting to explain to her
daughter the morning&#39;s plans. Then she had
turned and slowly retraced her steps. She had
seen and been humiliated by the flush on Ellen&#39;s
face and the flash in her eyes. It was humiliating
to think that her maid was indignant
over the way she was being treated by her
daughter. It is probably well that she did not
hear the maid&#39;s exclamation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The horrid cat! If I only dared tell Mr.
Erskine all about it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Burnham had gone downstairs again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
after a time. She had changed her street dress
first, and made a careful at-home toilet. She
had given certain additional directions to the
cook, with a view to doing honor to their unexpected
guests. She had made a special effort
to have Ellen understand that all was quite as it
should be, and had sternly assured herself that
such was the case. If she could not sympathize
with the sudden movements of young people on
hearing of the coming of friends, she deserved
to be set aside as too old to be endurable. It
was absurd in her to be so wedded to an old
custom! just as though any other day in the
week would not do as well as Friday. Then she
had gone to the living room which was Erskine&#39;s
favorite of the entire house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is such a home-y room, mamma,&quot; he used
to say, away back in his early boyhood. When
it had been refurnished, or at least renewed,
with a view to Erskine&#39;s home-coming, his
mother had taken pains to preserve the sense
of homeiness, and had seen to it that his pet
luxuries, sofa pillows, were in lavish evidence.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a charming room. Very long and many
windowed, with wide, low window-seats, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
tempting cosy-corners, piled high with cushions
so carefully chosen, as to size and harmony of
color, that they were in themselves studies in art.
There was a smaller room opening from this
and nearer the front entrance, which was used
as a reception room, and was furnished more after
the fashion of the conventional parlor; but
guests who, as Erskine phrased it, really &quot;belonged,&quot;
were always entertained in the living
room.</p>

<p class="indent">In the doorway of this room the mistress of the
house had stopped short and looked about her in
astonishment. It wore an unfamiliar air. The
easy-chairs, each one of which she had made a
study, until it seemed to have been created for
the particular niche in which it was placed, had
every one changed places and to the eyes of the
mistress of the house looked awkward and uncomfortable.
But that was foolish, she assured
herself quickly. Chairs, of course, belonged
wherever their friends chose to place them.
There were other changes. The window-seats
had been shorn of some of their largest and prettiest
cushions, and a little onyx table that had
occupied a quiet corner was gone. It had held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
a choice picture of Erskine&#39;s father, set in a
dainty frame, and near it had stood a tiny vase
which was daily filled with fresh blossoms.
Picture and vase and flowers had disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ellen,&quot; Mrs. Burnham had said, catching
sight of the girl in the next room, &quot;what has
happened here? Has there been an accident?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, m&#39;m,&quot; said Ellen, appearing in the opposite
doorway, duster in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t any accident, ma&#39;am, it was orders.
She didn&#39;t want such a lot of pillows here, she
said. It looked for all the world like a show
room, or as if it had been got ready for a church
fair. Those was her very words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind the pillows, Ellen.&quot; Mrs. Burnham
had spoken hastily, and was regretting that
she had spoken at all. &quot;It is the table, and
especially the picture about which I am inquiring.
I hope the picture is safe? It is the
best one we have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all safe, ma&#39;am; I looked out for that;
but that was orders, too. She said the room was
too full, and looked cluttery; and she said that
only country folks kept family pictures in their
parlors. And she had me take the table and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
picture and the vase up into the back attic.
She said the vase was a nuisance; it was always
tipping over and she didn&#39;t want it around in
the way. Of course I had to take them; you
told me to obey orders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ellen&#39;s indignation was getting the better of
her usual discreetness. It was her tone and
manner that recalled the elder woman to her
senses. She spoke with decision and dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, Ellen. Why should there be
occasion for mentioning that? Of course Mrs.
Erskine Burnham&#39;s orders are to be obeyed
equally with my own; or, if they conflict at any
time with my own, give hers the preference.
Especially should the parlors and sitting rooms
be arranged just as she wishes. Young people
care more about such little matters than we
older ones do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that her voice had been steady, and
she took care to make her movements quiet and
her manner natural and at ease. Not for the
world would she have had Ellen know of the
turmoil going on inside. It was the picture
that hurt her; or rather that emphasized the
hurt. Erskine&#39;s favorite picture of his father;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
the one that as a child he had daily kissed good
morning; the one that now after all these years
he always stood beside in silence for a moment,
after greeting her. And she could not recall that
he had ever forgotten to select from the flowers
he brought home, an offering for the tiny vase.</p>

<p class="indent">How was it possible for his wife to have spent
six months in his home without noting all this?
And noting it, how could she possibly have interfered
with that cherished corner?</p>

<p class="indent">The morning had been a distinct advance on
former experiences. The new daughter had evidently
misunderstood the spirit in which small
interferences and small slights had heretofore
been accepted, and determined on aggressive effort.
Long before this, and as often as she chose,
she had made what changes pleased her in the
more pretentious parlor, and Mrs. Burnham had
openly approved some of them and been pleasantly
silent over others. She had also given
explicit directions to the would-be rebel, Ellen,
that the &quot;new lady&#39;s&quot; slightest hint was to be
obeyed.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been no pettiness in her thoughts
about the changes. She was earnestly anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
to have her son&#39;s wife feel so entirely at home
that she would not need to hesitate about carrying
out her own tastes. But was it not to be
supposed that a wife would consult her husband&#39;s
tastes as well as her own? And his father&#39;s
picture that he had cherished ever since he was
a child! She had herself told Irene one morning,
standing before that very picture, how
Erskine had singled it out from all the others
and said decidedly: &quot;That one is papa.&quot; And
his wife could banish it to the attic!</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Erskine Burnham was used to mental
struggles. There had been times in her life
when her strong-willed feelings had got the upper
hand and swayed her for days together; but it
is doubtful if a more violent storm of feeling had
ever swept about her than surged that morning.
For a while the pent-up emotions of many weeks
were allowed their way. But only for a little
while. The Christian of many years&#39; experience
had herself too well in training for long submission
to the enemy&#39;s control. By the time
that delayed luncheon hour drew near she
believed that she was her quiet self again;
ready to receive and assist in entertaining her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
daughter&#39;s guests whoever they might be. As
was her habit when under the power of strong
feeling that must be held in check she took
refuge with her absent friends, and wrote a long
letter to Marian Dennis, ignoring the immediate
present utterly and revelling in certain happy
experiences of their past. When her unusually
lengthy epistle was finished, she was startled at
the lateness of the hour, and began to wonder
how certain details of the dinner could be managed
if luncheon were much longer delayed.
Just then Ellen knocked at her door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are &#39;most through luncheon, ma&#39;am,&quot;
was her message. &quot;I heard you moving around
and I thought I&#39;d venture to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Ellen, how is this? I did not hear any
call to luncheon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wasn&#39;t called, ma&#39;am. She said you
was likely asleep, and she wouldn&#39;t let me come
up and see. She thinks you don&#39;t do anything
but sleep when you are upstairs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This last was muttered, and not supposed to
be heard by her mistress. Ellen had evidently
reached the limit of her endurance. Since the
mistress said not a word, she ventured a further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
statement. &quot;There&#39;s four of them, ma&#39;am,
besides Mrs. Burnham; and it&#39;s long after three,
and they&#39;re on the last course. I thought you
would be wanting something to eat by this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Outwardly, Ruth was herself again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Ellen,&quot; she said. &quot;Since I am
so late, I think I will not go down until the
guests have left the dining room. I am not
in the least hungry; I think on the whole I
should prefer to wait until dinner is served.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her tone was gentleness itself; but there
was in it that quality which made Ellen understand
that she was dismissed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mrs. Burnham went back to her room
and sat down near the open window. The sweet
spring air came to her, laden with the breath of
the flowers she loved, but their odor almost
sickened her. She had thought that her battle
was fought and victory declared, and behold
it was only a lull! What was she to do?
What ought she to do? Should she go down
to the guests, apologize for tardiness, and act
as though nothing had occurred to disturb her?
That, of course, would be the sensible way;
but,&mdash;could she do it well, with the closely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
observing and indignant Ellen to confront?
It scarcely seemed possible; and she blushed for
shame over the thought that she was afraid
to meet the anxious eyes of her maid.</p>

<p class="indent">Even while she waited and considered, a
carriage swung around the corner and stopped
before her door. Three ladies alighted, evidently
with the intent of paying an afternoon
visit. Among them was Mrs. Stuart, her most
intimate acquaintance. Now indeed she would
have to go down; but she would wait for a summons,
that would make it appear more natural.
So she waited; but no summons came. The
ladies, all of them her friends, made their call
and departed. And others came&mdash;a constant
succession of callers; the new spring day had
tempted everybody out. Most of the people
Mrs. Burnham knew by sight; some of them
were comparative strangers, paying their first
calls. What was being given as the reason why
she was not there to meet them? The words
of Ellen recurred to her, words that she had
considered it wisdom not to seem to hear:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She thinks you don&#39;t do anything but sleep
when you are upstairs.&quot; The matron&#39;s lip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
curled a little. She was not given to sleeping by
daylight; a fifteen minutes&#39; nap after luncheon
was always sufficient, and even that was frequently
omitted.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a strange afternoon, the strangest that
she had ever passed. She kept her seat at the
window, almost within view, if the guests had
raised their eyes, and saw friends who rarely
got out to make calls, and whom she had
always made special efforts to entertain. What
must they think of her, at home, and well, and
not there to meet them? And why was she
not there? What strange freak or whim was
this? Could her daughter-in-law hope to make
a prisoner of her in her own house? Why did
she sit there in that inane way as though she were
in very deed a prisoner? Why not go down, as
a matter of course, and take her proper place as
usual? But the longer she delayed and watched
those groups of callers come and go, the more
impossible it seemed to do this. With each
fresh arrival she felt sure that she would be summoned,
and waited nervously for Ellen&#39;s knock.
But no Ellen came.</p>

<p class="indent">The day waned and the hour for Erskine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
dinner drew near; and still Mrs. Burnham sat
like one dazed at that open window. An entire
afternoon lost. When, before, had she spent
a day in such fashion?</p>

<p class="indent">She leaned forward, presently, and watched
Erskine&#39;s car stop at the corner, and watched his
springing step as he came with glad haste to his
home, and received his bow and smile as he
looked up at her window. Now indeed she must
go down; and go before he could come in search
of her, and question her with keen gaze and
searching words. Her eyes told no tales, they
were dry, and there were bright spots glowing
on her cheeks. She had not known what she
should say, just how she should manage his
solicitous inquiries. She would make no plans,
she told herself; things must just take their
course. Matters had so shaped themselves
that any planning of hers was useless.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she had gone down to that cheerful
dining room, and listened to the chatter of her
daughter-in-law, and replied to her son as best
she could. Now she was back in her room, and
Erskine and his wife were out on the porch in the
moonlight, and that slight, frequent cough was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
coming up to her. Presently he would come,
and she dreaded it. For almost the first time
in her life she dreaded to meet her son. He
would be insistent, and she was not good at
dissembling. And yet, he must not know, he
must never know how she had been treated that
day. If only he would stay away and give her
a chance to think, to pray, to grow calm.
Should she lock her door?</p>

<p class="indent">Lock out her son? She could not do that!
but she could not talk with him to-night; she
would turn off her light and ask him not to light
up again and not to stay, because she was tired.
That at least would be true: she was tired.
For the first time in her life she was tired of life!
She must get into a different spirit from this.
After Erskine had kissed her good-night she
would have it out with her heart, or her will.</p>

<p class="indent">Hark! he was coming! they were coming
upstairs together, and Irene was chattering.
Out went the lights in the mother&#39;s room. She
heard the wife pass on to her own room, she
heard her son, stepping lightly, stopping a moment
before her door, then he too passed on,
to his own room, and closed his door.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXIII" id="chXIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p class="h3">WAS IRENE RIGHT?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">If</span> she could have heard some of the talk that
had taken place on the porch in the moonlight,
Mrs. Burnham would have better understood
her son&#39;s consideration. They had taken
but very few turns on the porch when Erskine
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma has gone upstairs. I think I must
run up and see her a few minutes, Irene. She
does not seem to feel quite well to-night; although
in some respects I think I never saw
her looking better; her eyes were very bright,
did you notice? Perhaps she is feverish. Did
she speak of having cold?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all; I have no idea that she doesn&#39;t
feel quite well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was something peculiar about her.
Didn&#39;t she really go out at all to-day? That
is certainly unusual; you have seen how particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
she is to keep her Friday programme.
Irene, I am really afraid that she is ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She isn&#39;t ill at all, you fussy boy; I think
you are absurd about your mother. You fuss
over her as though she were a spoiled child.
That is just the word for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; he said good-humouredly. &quot;I
must go and &#39;fuss over&#39; her, enough to know
why she overturned her usual programme,&quot;
and he moved toward the door.</p>

<p class="indent">His wife held to his arm and tried to arrest
his steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t go in, Erskine; it is stuffy inside, and
I haven&#39;t seen you since morning. As for that
programme which worries you so much, if you
were not dreadfully stupid to-night you would
understand that it is I who overturned it.
I ran away with the carriage, I told you&mdash;almost
as soon as you went yourself. I was so
charmed with the idea of seeing the Langhams
again that I forgot everything else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband turned then to look at her, his
face expressing surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you take our carriage, dear? I supposed
you ordered one from the livery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
His wife pretended to pout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are cross to-night, Erskine. I don&#39;t see
why I should. I thought &#39;Our&#39; meant mine
as much as hers. Why shouldn&#39;t she order one
if she wanted it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed, as though he was expected to
understand that she was talking nonsense,
but he spoke with an undertone of decision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh if it comes to that, the carriage as well as
the horses are undoubtedly my mother&#39;s, but
she and I have never drawn any hard and fast
lines about &#39;mine&#39; and &#39;thine&#39;; I have always
found her too willing to give up her convenience
for mine. For that reason, perhaps, I have been
careful to plan systematically for her, and to
anticipate and overrule her personal sacrifices
as much as possible, and I know that you will
delight to join me in it. I am afraid that she
was much inconvenienced to-day; still, that
cannot be why she did not see any of her friends.
What reason did she give, dear, for not coming
down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene pouted in earnest this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Erskine, you are strangely obtuse!
I have explained at least three times that mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
spent the afternoon in her room, and that I gave
orders that she should not be disturbed. I
thought I should be commended for it instead
of blamed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t had a thought of blaming you,
Irene, but I am a trifle anxious about my mother,
and what you say only increases the anxiety.
She has never been given to sleeping much in the
daytime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh what nonsense! as though you knew
what she did all day, while you are in town! Of
course she sleeps; old people always do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother isn&#39;t old, Irene.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 400px;">
<a name="f167" id="f167"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/f167.jpg" width="400" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">My mother isn&#39;t old, Irene.</span>&quot;&mdash;<i>Page 167.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, I wonder? you ridiculous boy!
When should people begin to be called old, pray,
if not at fifty? And she is more than that.
She is within a few years of Auntie&#39;s age, and you
thought she was an old woman, and were always
preaching to me about how patient I must be
with her on that account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband gave her a troubled, half-startled
look. His mother nearly as old as the
invalid aunt who had seemed to him old enough
to be his grandmother!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; he asked helplessly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
His wife laughed satirically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure of what, my beloved dunce? That
your mother is fifty-three? Of course I am.
It was only a few days ago that she showed me
her gold-lined silver cup, that has the imprint
of her first teeth and is dated for her first birthday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then her face sobered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I&#39;ll tell you another way in which I know
it, Erskine. She is growing nervous and over-sensitive,
as old people always do. I can see a
great difference in her, even in the short time
that I have been here. It is nothing to worry
about, of course; simply something to be expected
as among the infirmities of age. You
ought to have married me six or eight years
before you did; it would have been easier for
her. She simply cannot get used to your having
a wife. &#39;My son&#39; has &#39;lived and breathed and
had his being&#39; so many years for her sake alone,
that to share him with another is a bitter experience.
She doesn&#39;t love me one bit, Erskine,
and it is not my fault. If I were an angel
from heaven, it wouldn&#39;t make any difference,
provided I had presumed to marry you. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
makes it hard for both of us; and for that very
reason it would be much better if you and I
were in a little house of our own. She would
get used to it much easier if she did not have
me continually before her eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If she could have seen distinctly the look of
pain on her husband&#39;s face, as she got off these
sentences with composed voice, it might have
moved her to pity for him. When he spoke,
his voice was almost sharp. &quot;I am sure you are
mistaken, Irene; utterly mistaken. My mother
wanted me to marry; she has wanted it for
years; at times she was actually troubled because
I did not, and spoke of it very seriously.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene laughed lightly as she gave his arm
some half-reproving, half-caressing pats.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blind as a bat, you are!&quot; she said. &quot;Despite
all your supposed wisdom. On general
principles your mother wanted you to marry,
of course, because that is the proper thing for
a man to do. But marriage in the abstract
and marriage in the concrete are two very
different matters. There! haven&#39;t I put that
well? Those are lawyers&#39; terms, aren&#39;t they?
They sound learned, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
He smiled in an absent-minded way at her
folly. His thoughts were elsewhere. Something
in the turn of her sentence had carried
him suddenly back to a moon-lighted evening
in which he had walked and talked with Alice
Warder, and he could seem to hear her voice
again as she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know your mother loves me, Erskine,
almost as she would a daughter; and I also
know that she loves me a great deal better
because her son is like a brother to me instead
of being&mdash;something else.&quot; He remembered
how he had puzzled over it all, and studied
his mother&#39;s face, and half decided that Alice
was right. Was Irene right, also? Was his
mother grieved that he had married at all?
Was it possible that she could have stooped
to so small a feeling as jealousy!</p>

<p class="indent">His wife laid her head caressingly against his
arm and said softly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Erskine. We can&#39;t
either of us help it now; and we must just make
the best of it and do as well as we can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in his life, as those low tremulously
spoken words sounded in his ears, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
feeling very like resentment toward his mother
swelled in Erskine Burnham&#39;s heart, and a
torrent of tenderness rushed over him toward
the wife who had no one in all the world but
himself. This was what she had often told him.</p>

<p class="indent">All things considered it is perhaps not strange
that he did not visit his mother&#39;s room that
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that when they went upstairs he
paused before her door and listened, and told
himself that she was asleep and he would not
disturb her. But there had been nights before,
many of them, in which he had waited at her
door and listened, and murmured: &quot;Mommie,&quot;
and received a prompt invitation to enter.
On this evening, though the hour was not late,
he was not insistent. He made no attempt to
knock or to speak. It was his concession to that
new thought about her being an old woman.
Or was it a slight concession, unawares, to that
new feeling of resentment?</p>

<p class="indent">His mother, knowing nothing of what had
been talked over in the moonlight, held her
breath and waited. Of course Erskine would
come to say good night. She forgot that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
had wished he would not come! When his
footsteps moved toward his own room, she
waited a minute, then stepped into the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine!&quot; she said; but she said it very
softly and he did not hear her. She could hear
his voice. He was talking with his wife. The
mother slipped softly back to her own room
and locked her door. It was not late, and she
and her son were only across a hall from each
other; yet, for the first time in her life under
like conditions, if she slept at all it must be without
his good-night kiss. There is no true mother
but will appreciate the situation. There are,
it is true, mothers who are not accustomed to
good-night kisses from their grown sons, and
so would not miss them, but they are accustomed
to a certain atmosphere, and they can
understand what it would be like to be suddenly
removed from it.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham went to her bed as usual, after
a while, like the sensible woman that she was.
That she did not go to sleep was not her fault,
for she made earnest effort to do so. She told
herself repeatedly and with a calmness which
was itself unnatural, that nothing terrible had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
happened, and that she was above making herself
miserable over trifles. Was her daughter-in-law&#39;s
indifference to her only a trifle? She
made a distinct pause over that word &quot;indifference&quot;
and selected it with care; of course
it was nothing more; and&mdash;yes, it was a trifle.
How could one who knew her so little and had
so little in common with her life be expected
to be other than indifferent? Erskine had
expected more, very much more, but Erskine
was&mdash;was different from other people.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, all her heart went out in a
great swell of tenderness for Erskine. She
did not stop to reason about it, she did not wait
to ask herself why Erskine, who had everything,
should be the subject of her shielding care;
she simply took him metaphorically once more
into her mother-arms and vowed to shield him
from even a hint of solicitude on her account.
She would rise above it all; she would treat
Irene exactly as though she were at all times
the loving and considerate daughter that Erskine
believed she was; she would let him be
blind to her faults, she would even help him
to increased blindness. That was her work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
for him now; she would accept it and be diligent
in it. The thought helped to quiet
her, but it did not bring her sleep. She was
broad staring awake. She told herself that
sleep seemed an impossibility; she wondered
curiously how she had ever slept.</p>

<p class="indent">A low murmur of talk came to her from the
room across the hall. They were not sleeping,
either. Could she have heard some of the talk
in that room across the hall it would have made
things plainer to her than they were.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one thing, dear,&quot; Erskine Burnham
was saying to his wife, &quot;which we must look
upon as settled. We can have no home apart
from my mother&#39;s. You can plan for summer
cottages if you will, and where you will, for a
stay of a few weeks, but the real home must
always be here. I have taken care of my
mother, practically all my life; and now if
she is, as you say, growing old, it is not the
time to make any change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not even though the change would be a
benefit to her?&quot; His wife intended her words
to represent a playful sarcasm, but Erskine&#39;s
face had clouded and he had answered quickly:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;No; not even under such an extraordinary
supposition as that. Young as I was when my
father died, he said that to me about my mother
which has always made her seem to me as a
trust; and I must be true to my trust in any case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment&#39;s constrained silence between
them his face had cleared and he had laughed
cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we need not be so solemn over it, Irene.
I know my mother, and I have no fears as to
her wishes. Nothing that anybody could say
would make me believe that she could be happier
away from me than with me. I would
almost not believe it if she said so herself.
Quite, indeed. I should feel that she had over-persuaded
herself in some spirit of sacrifice.
There is material in my mother for martyrdom,
Irene. It shall be your and my study to prevent
her from indulging in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His wife made no attempt to reply. She was
in some respects a wise woman and she understood
that there was a time when silence was
golden. When she spoke again, it was to ask if he
did not think curtains lined with rose color would
be an improvement on those now separating
their dressing room from the main apartment.</p>

<h2><a name="chXIV" id="chXIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p class="h3">THE GENERAL MANAGER</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;Mother,</span> don&#39;t you think that you are
being rather hard on Irene to undertake
to hold her to restrictions to which she has
never been accustomed, and which to her seem
narrow and unreasonable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine Burnham had followed his mother to
her room evidently with a view to speaking to
her alone, his wife having gone on into her own
room and closed the door. Even though she
had not felt it in the tone of his voice, Mrs.
Burnham would have known by her son&#39;s opening
word that he was annoyed.</p>

<p class="indent">He rarely used the word &quot;mother&quot; when addressing
her directly. As a rule the habits of
his childhood prevailed, and &quot;mamma&quot; was
the name in frequent use; or, oftener still perhaps,
when they were quite alone, his special
pet name for her, &quot;mommie,&quot; came naturally to
his lips. But of late she had heard, oftener than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
ever before, what was to him a colder term
&quot;Mother,&quot; and had learned to know what it
meant.</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated a moment before replying, and
her hesitation seemed to irritate her son. He
spoke quickly, with a note in his voice which
she had never found in it before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must confess, mother, that I am surprised
and not a little disappointed at the course you
are taking. When I brought Irene here, it was
not only in the hope but the assured belief that
I was bringing her to what she had never really
had before&mdash;a mother,&mdash;and that you would
become to her in time, what you have always
been to me. I never for a moment dreamed of
your standing coldly at one side, not only indifferent
to her innocent devices for pleasure,
but actually blocking her way! If I could
have imagined such a condition of things, I
would have better understood her feeling from
the very first that we ought to go into a house
of our own, where she would not feel herself an
interloper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham was ready then with her reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine, I do not think Irene could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
understood me. I made no attempt to hold
her to any restrictions. She asked a direct
question about my own views, which, of course,
I answered. But I ought not to have to explain
to my son that I do not try to force my opinions
upon any one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That kind of thing is not necessary, mother,
between us; but you know very well that there
are ways of expressing one&#39;s opinions that
effectually trammel others of the same household.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The simple truth is that Irene has played
cards, for amusement, in her own and her
friends&#39; parlors, ever since she was old enough
to play games of any kind; and to her, our ideas
concerning cards seem as absurd as though
applied to tennis or golf. Personally, I see
no reason why she should not continue to amuse
herself in her own way. It is true I do not
play cards; but she knows, what both you and
I understand perfectly, that this is a concession
on my part to the extreme views of my
mother, who could hardly expect my wife to
have exactly the same spirit. I have told Irene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
that out of deference to your feelings, I do not
want her to entertain her friends with cards, in
the parlors, but she certainly ought to be left
free to do in her own rooms what she pleases.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At almost any other period in Mrs. Burnham&#39;s
life, a formal and elaborate expression of her
son&#39;s views upon any subject, given in a haughty
and almost dictatorial tone, such as he was
using, would have filled his mother with astonishment
and pain. She was almost curiously
interested in herself on discovering that she
had passed that stage, and was occupying her
mind for the moment with quite a different
matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Why had Irene chosen just this line of attack?
What did she hope to accomplish by such a singularly
distorted representation of their talk
together? It must have been sadly distorted
to have moved Erskine to an exhibition of
annoyance such as he had never before shown
to her. Yet had he been present at the interview,
his mother felt confident that it would not
have disturbed him.</p>

<p class="indent">She went swiftly over the talk, in memory,
while Erskine waited, and fingered the books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
and magazines on her table with the air of a
nervous man who wanted to appear at ease.
It had been a brief conversation, not significant
at least to an observer, in any way. Irene had
been looking over the mail, and had exclaimed
at an invitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Wheelers are giving another card party;
what indefatigable entertainers they are! it
isn&#39;t a month since their last one. This time
it is a very select few, in Mrs. Harry Wheeler&#39;s
rooms. That is what Erskine and I must do,
since you won&#39;t allow cards in the parlors.
Have you really such queer notions, mother, as
Erskine pretends?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham remembered just how carefully
she had watched her words, in reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t play cards, Irene, if that is what
you mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I mean a great deal more than that.
Erskine says you won&#39;t allow such wicked things
in your part of the house. Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have never had them in the house since
Judge Burnham changed his views with regard
to them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, did he change? how curious, for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
lawyer, too! I don&#39;t believe Erskine will get
notional as he grows older. He isn&#39;t one of
that kind.&quot; Whereupon the older woman had
turned resolutely away, resolved to speak no
more words on the subject unless they were
spoken in Erskine&#39;s presence. It was this conversation,
reported, that had brought her son
to her in his new and lofty mood of guardian
of his wife&#39;s liberties! Just as he tossed down
the magazine with which he had been playing,
with the air of one who meant to wait no longer,
his mother spoke with gentle dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine, of course your rooms are your own,
to do with as you will. I made no restrictions
and hinted at none. On my desk under the paper-weight
is the quotation you wished looked up,
and also the statistics about which you asked.&quot;
Then she turned and passed out, to the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">All this was on a midsummer morning nearly
three months removed from that moonlighted
evening on which this mother had renewed her
solemn pledge to be to her son and her son&#39;s
wife all that they would let her be. In the face
of steady resistance she had been fairly true to
the pledge. It had now become quite plain to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
her that it was not chance, nor mere heedlessness,
that was working against her, but that Mrs.
Erskine Burnham meant to resist her, meant
to look upon her as a force in her way, to be
got rid of if possible; if not by persuading her
son to leave her, then, perhaps by making her
so uncomfortable that she would leave him.
The plan was not succeeding. Ruth Erskine
Burnham had lived through too many trying
experiences before this time to be easily routed.
She was in the home to which her husband had
brought her as a bride, and she meant that
nothing but a stern sense of duty should ever
separate her from it.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet Mrs. Erskine Burnham, if she had but
known it, had accomplished much. The mother
no longer turned with a sickening pain from the
thought of Erskine having other home than hers.
There were times when she could almost have
joined his wife in pleading for that &quot;cunning
little cottage.&quot; There were days wherein she
told herself breathlessly and very secretly, that
for Erskine to come home to her for a single
half-hour, <i>alone</i>, would compensate for days
of absence.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
But if she had changed her point of view, so
had Irene. His wife talked to him no more of
a home by themselves. She was growing fond
of the many-roomed, rambling old house whose
utter abandonment to luxurious comfort was
the talk and the pride of the neighborhood; and
was the result of years of careful study on the
part of a cultured woman accustomed to luxuries.</p>

<p class="indent">The new Mrs. Burnham developed an interest
in the carefully-trained servants who had been
a part of the establishment for so many years
that they said &quot;our&quot; and &quot;ours&quot; in speaking
of its belongings. She came to realize, at least
in a measure, that servants like these were
hard to secure, and harder to keep. She began
also to like the comfort of proprietorship, without
the accompanying sense of responsibility.
The machinery of this house could move on
steadily without break or jar, and without an
hour of care or thought bestowed by her; yet
her slightest order was obeyed promptly and
skilfully.</p>

<p class="indent">Her orders were growing more and more frequent,
and it was becoming increasingly apparent
to those who had eyes to see that &quot;young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
Mrs. Burnham,&quot; as some of them called her, was
assuming the reins and being recognized as the
head of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Ellen, the maid who had been with Mrs. Burnham
since Erskine&#39;s boyhood, and who was a
rebel against other authority than hers, had
openly rebelled, one day, and with blazing eyes
that yet softened when the tears came, assured
Ruth that she could not have two mistresses,
especially when the one who wasn&#39;t mistress at
all took pains to contradict the orders of the
other; and if she had got to be ordered about
all the time by Mrs. Erskine, the sooner she
went, the better.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, Ellen,&quot; Mrs. Burnham had said,
holding her tones to cold dignity. &quot;I shall be
sorry to part with you, but it is quite certain
that so long as you remain in the house you
must obey Mrs. Erskine Burnham&#39;s slightest
wish. If you cannot do this, of course we must
separate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Ellen went. In a perfect storm of tears
and sobs and regrets, it is true; but she went.
This arrangement pleased just one person.
Erskine openly complained that her successor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
was not and never would be a circumstance to
Ellen, and made his mother confess that she
missed Ellen sorely, and asked her why, after
being faithfully served for twenty years, she
could not have borne with a few peculiarities.
His mother was thankful that he did not insist
upon knowing just what form her peculiarities
took, and his wife&#39;s eyes sparkled. She had
recognized Ellen from the first as an enemy, and
had meant to be rid of her.</p>

<p class="indent">In short, Mrs. Erskine Burnham had settled
down. She told her special friends with a
cheerful sigh that she had sacrificed herself to
her husband&#39;s mother, who was growing old and
ought not to be burdened with the care of a
house. So, much as they would have enjoyed a
home to themselves, they had determined to
stay where they were.</p>

<p class="indent">So steady and skilful were this General&#39;s
movements toward supremacy that Ruth herself
scarcely realized the fact that when she gave
an order in these days, she did it hesitatingly,
often adding as an afterthought:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let that be the arrangement, unless Mrs.
Erskine Burnham has other plans; if she has,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
remember, I am not at all particular.&quot; And
she was never surprised any more by the discovery
that there was a totally different arrangement.
It was therefore in exceeding bad
taste for Erskine Burnham to present himself
to his mother in lofty mood and threaten her
with a separate home for himself and wife. One
of his mother&#39;s chief concerns at this time was
to shield him from the knowledge that she
sometimes prayed for solitude as the safest way
out of the thickening clouds. That he did not
realize any of this can only be attributed to the
condition of which his wife often accused him;
namely, that he was &quot;as blind as a bat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The proposed card-party at the Wheelers&#39; came
off in due time, both Irene and Erskine being
among the guests. Within the month, Irene
gave what the next morning&#39;s social column
called &quot;an exclusive and charming affair&quot; of
the same kind in her own rooms. It is true
that she had schemed for a different result from
this. She had meant to give a card party on a
larger scale. Her careful rendering to her husband
of the talk about restrictions had been intended
to call from him the declaration that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
parlors were as much theirs as his mother&#39;s, and
that if she chose to play cards in them, no one
should disturb her. She miscalculated. Instead
of this, his deliverance was more emphatic
than ever before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remember, Irene, that my mother&#39;s sense
of the fitness of things must never be infringed
upon in any way that can disturb her. Our
rooms are our castle and we will do with them as
we choose; but no cards downstairs, remember,
or anything else that will disturb her&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prejudices!&quot; his wife had interrupted in a
manner that she had intended should be playful;
but he had spoken quickly and with dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, prejudices if you will. I was going
to say traditions; but if you prefer the other
word, it doesn&#39;t matter. Whatever they are,
they are to be respected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Irene, having learned some time before this
that such deliverances on the part of her husband
were to be respected, took care to keep
within the limits of their own rooms. But she
took a little private revenge upon her mother-in-law,
given in that especially trying would-be
playful tone of hers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
&quot;I am sorry that your prejudices&mdash;oh, no,
pardon me, I mean your traditions&mdash;will not
allow you to meet our guests this evening; but I
suppose that would be wicked, too? Pray how is
your absence to be accounted for? Must I trump
up an attack of mumps, or dumps, or what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As for Erskine, he remained happily unconscious
of all these small stings. He was much
engrossed in business cares, and left home early
and returned late, so that in reality he knew
little of what took place during his absence.
That all was not quite as he had hoped between
his wife and his mother he could not help seeing,
but he told himself that he must not be unreasonable;
that two people as differently reared
as they had been must have time to assimilate;
probably they were doing very well, and it was he
who was struggling for the impossible. So he
straightway put aside and forgot the words of
dignified reproach that he had addressed to his
mother, and she became &quot;mommie&quot; again, and
always his second kiss of greeting was for her.
And the mother during these days thanked God
that she was able to hide her disappointment
and her pain, and meet him always with a smile.</p>

<h2><a name="chXV" id="chXV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p class="h3">LOOKING BACKWARD</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> Burnham came into the room with
the air of one in doubt as to whom she
was to meet. Probably it was some one whom
she ought to recognize; and if she did not, it
would be embarrassing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She would not give any name, ma&#39;am,&quot;
the maid had said. &quot;She says she is an old
acquaintance, and she wants to see if you will
know her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Ruth did not know her. She had a fairly
good memory for faces, yet as she advanced she
told herself that this woman was mistaken in
the person. There must be some other Mrs.
Burnham whom she had known. But the lady
who arose to meet her was apparently not disappointed,
and was at her ease and eager.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you will forgive this intrusion, dear
Mrs. Burnham. I could not resist the temptation
to see if you had a lingering remembrance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
of the silly girl to whom you were once very good.
It was foolish in me to fancy such a thing. I
was just at the age to change much in a few
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham was studying the fair and
singularly reposeful face; taking in unconsciously
at the same time the grace of the whole
perfect picture, hair and eyes and dress and form,
all in exquisite harmony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A perfect lady!&quot; she told herself. &quot;How
rarely the phrase fits, and how exactly it applies
here. Yet where before have I seen that
face?&quot; She was back in the old college town,
away back, among the early years. What had
suddenly taken her there? She was&mdash;this
was not!&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are surely not,&quot; she began, and hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">The fair face broke into rippling smiles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;I am. Do you really
remember Mamie Parker just a little bit?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember her, perfectly, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am changed? Yes, fifteen years make
changes in young people. I was not much over
eighteen then, and very young for my years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
But you have not changed, Mrs. Burnham; I
should have known you anywhere. Perhaps
that is partly because I have carried you around
in my heart all these years. It must be beautiful
to be able to do for girls all that you did
for me. If I could do it, if I could be to one
young girl what you became to me, I should
know that I had not lived in vain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham was almost embarrassed.
What did the woman mean!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear friend, I do not understand,&quot; she
said. &quot;There must be some strange mistake.
Have you not confused me with some other
friend? What could I possibly have done for
you in the few, the very few times that we met?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her caller laughed a low, sweet laugh, and as
she spoke made an inimitable gesture with her
hands that emphasized her words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did everything for me,&quot; she said.
&quot;Everything! You gave me ideals, you refashioned
my entire view of life; you were the
means God used to breathe into me the spirit
of real living. May I claim a little of your time
to-day, and tell you just a little bit of the story,
for a purpose? I had only this one day here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
and I felt compelled to intrude without permission.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham heard her almost as one in a
dream. She was struggling with her memories;
trying to find in this fair vision, with her
refined voice and dress, and cultured language
and perfect manner, a trace of the singularly
ill-bred, loud-voiced, outspoken Mamie Parker.
How had such a transformation been possible?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have but one day here?&quot; she said, remembering
her duties as hostess. &quot;What does
that mean, please? Are you staying in the neighborhood,
and will you not come to us for a visit?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, I cannot. I am about to leave
the country, and am paying a very brief farewell
visit to my friends the Carletons, who are
at their summer home in Carleton Park. I
have broken away to-day from the numerous
engagements they have made for me, and run
over here alone, in the hope of securing an
interview with you; I have been planning for
this a long time. Dear Mrs. Burnham, may I
claim the privilege of an old acquaintance and
ask to see you quite alone where there will be
no danger of interruption? I want to talk fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
and put a good deal into a small space, because
my own time is so limited, and I do not want to
take more of yours than is necessary. I have a
purpose which I think, and I hope you will
think, justifies my intrusion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still as one under a spell, Mrs. Burnham led
the way to her private sitting room and established
her guest in an easy-chair, from which
she looked about her eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is charming!&quot; she said. &quot;I remember
your other room perfectly, Mrs. Burnham, and I
think I should have recognized this as yours
without being told. Rooms have a great deal
of individuality, don&#39;t you think? Do you
remember that parlor in the house where my
dear brother Jim boarded? No, of course you
don&#39;t, but I do, and I thought it very elegant
until I was admitted to yours. May I tell you
very briefly just a little of what you have been
to me? That winter when I met you and your
son&mdash;it was my first flight from home. I was
young, you remember, and unformed in every
way; I was, in fact, a young simpleton, with as
little knowledge of the world as a girl reared as
I had been would be likely to have. Up to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
time I had cared very little for study of any kind.
My opportunities were limited enough, but I
had made very poor use even of them. My
chief idea of a successful life was to marry young,
some one who had plenty of money and who
would be good to me and let me have a good
time. I was what is called a popular girl in the
little country village where I lived, and was
much sought after because I was what they
called &#39;lively&#39; and could &#39;make things go.&#39;
When my brother invited me to visit him, I
went in a flutter of anticipation. I had grown
rather tired of the country boys by whom I
was surrounded, and I believed that the fateful
hour of my life had at last arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped to laugh at her folly; then said,
apologetically, &quot;I am giving you the whole
crude story, but it is for a purpose. I can
laugh at that silly girl, now, but there have been
times in my life when I cried over her. She
knew so little in any direction, and there were
such possibilities of danger, such imminent fear
of a wrecked life. She needed a friend, as every
girl does; and I can never cease to be thankful
that she found one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
&quot;Mrs. Burnham, I presume you have never
understood what you did for me by calling on me
and inviting me to your home, and opening to
me a new world. We were very plain people
with limited opportunities in every way, and
my father&#39;s sudden financial success but a short
time before had almost turned our heads; mine,
at least, so that I was ready to be injured in
many ways. Do you remember me sufficiently
to realize the possibilities?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember you perfectly, my dear,&quot; said
her puzzled and charmed hostess. &quot;But I do
not understand in the least why you think, or
how you can think, that I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Parker interrupted her eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham, you were a revelation to
me. I had never before come into close contact
with a perfect lady. At first, I was
afraid of you, which was a new feeling to me,
and in itself good for me; and then, for a
while, I hated you; I thought that you came
between me and some of my ambitions, I
called them; now I know that they were utter
follies.&quot; There was a heightened color on the
fair face, and for a moment her eyes drooped.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
Then she laughed softly at her girlish follies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I recovered from them,&quot; she said briskly,
&quot;and enshrined you in my heart; made you
my idol, and, better than that, my ideal. I
had discovered from you what woman was
meant to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, dear friend, I learned another lesson
also, deeper and more far-reaching than any
other. Up to that time I had always thought
of religion as a very serious but somewhat tiresome
experience that came to the old, or the
sick, after they had got all they could out of life.
It was Mr. Erskine Burnham who first showed
me my utter misunderstanding of the whole
matter. I do not know that he understood at
the time what he was doing for me, but he gave
me a hint of what Jesus Christ was, not only to
you, but to himself, a young man in the first
flush of youthful successes. I could not understand
it at first, and it half vexed me by its
strangeness; but there came a time in my life,
afterward, when I was disappointed in all my
plans, and unhappy. Then I thought of what
had been said to me about Christ, and, almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
as an experiment, I tried it. Mrs. Burnham,
He stooped even to that low plane and revealed
Himself to me, and I have counted it all joy to
love and serve Him ever since And for this,
too, I have to thank you and yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; said Mrs. Burnham, the tears
shining in her eyes, &quot;thank you; thank you
very much; it is beautiful, although I do not
understand it in the least&mdash;my part of it; I
did nothing, <i>nothing</i>! I thought of it afterward
with deep regret; what I might have said, and
did not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did better than that,&quot; said Miss Parker,
gently. &quot;You <i>lived</i>. But now, believe me,
I did not intrude upon your leisure merely to
talk about myself. I wanted you to understand
the possibility of saving a girl&#39;s life to her,
because&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She broke off suddenly to introduce what
seemed an entirely irrelevant topic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham, I saw your daughter down
town to-day, for a moment. I did not know her,
and should not have imagined it was she, if I
had not been told. She has changed very much
since I saw her last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
&quot;Were you acquainted with my daughter,
Miss Parker? Is it Miss Parker, now? I am
taking a great deal for granted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes; I am still &#39;Miss Parker&#39;; and expect
so to remain. No, I cannot be said to
have been acquainted with your daughter, though
I knew of her; knew a great deal about her, in
fact, when she was a young girl. They were the
one great family in our little town, Mrs. Burnham&mdash;her
uncle&#39;s family, with whom she lived;
they had a fine old place, three miles from the
station, and your daughter used to drive to and
from the train in what seemed to me then like
royal state. I watched her on all possible
occasions and admired and envied her always,
though I do not suppose she ever heard of me
in her life. She was not so very much older
than I, only three years, but I remember I was
still counted as a little girl when her sudden
marriage took us all by surprise and overwhelmed
me with jealous envy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; said Mrs. Burnham, sitting
erect and looking not only perplexed but
troubled. &quot;I am somewhat dazed by this sudden
return to the long ago, and I must be getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
things mixed. I thought until a moment ago
that you were speaking of my son&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I am, Mrs. Burnham. She was Irene
Carpenter when I was at the envious stage;
and she became Irene Somerville in the autumn
that I was fourteen. I shall never forget the
vision I had of her on her wedding day. It was
at the station and the train was late, so I had
ample opportunity to admire and make note of
and sigh over the glories of her bridal travelling
outfit. Although I was only fourteen and accounted
a little girl by others, I by no means
considered myself such; and the wild and foolish
visions I had already indulged with regard to
my own splendid future, make me blush even
now to recall. Girls are so foolish, Mrs. Burnham,
and so easily led! If there were only
always some wise, sweet one at hand to lead
them safely!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham arose suddenly and closed both
of the doors opening into the hall. She knew
that her son was in town, and that his wife had
gone by appointment to meet him there; but it
seemed to her that such extraordinary talk as
this must be closed away from the hall through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
which they must presently pass. What could
this woman mean? She but fourteen when
Irene was married? Yet she was at least eighteen
when she visited her brother in the college
town, and that was nearly fifteen years
ago! Irene a married woman seventeen or
eighteen years ago! She could see a line in that
fateful foreign letter from her son as distinctly
as though she were reading it from the page,
&#39;although she is so young, barely twenty-six,
she has,&#39; etc. Of course there was some absurd
mistake. Irene could not have been more than
eight or nine years old at that time when some
one whom Mamie Parker fancied was the same
person, was married.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old do you think my son&#39;s wife is?&quot;
she asked suddenly. A few statistics, such as
she could furnish, would help to clear up this
absurd blunder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I know exactly. I have a vivid recollection
of the wonderful doings there were in
honor of her sixteenth birthday. It happens that
our birthdays fall on the very same month and
day, the eleventh of November; so that on
the day she was sixteen, I was thirteen. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
remember how sorely I took to heart the contrast
between the two celebrations. It was
before my father had made his successes, and
we were much straitened at the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham&#39;s pulses were athrob with her
effort at self-control. It was true that Irene&#39;s
birthday fell on the eleventh of November. It
had been celebrated with much circumstance
that very season; but instead of its being her
twenty-seventh, Miss Parker&#39;s story would
make it her thirty-seventh! That was absurd!
And yet&mdash;how often had the thought occurred
to her that Irene looked much older than
her years! Her maiden name, too, was Carpenter,
and her married name had been Somerville.
Still, there must have been a cousin, or
some near relative of the same name. It was
an insult to the family to suppose for a moment
that Irene could deceive her husband as to her
exact age!</p>

<p class="indent">And then, Miss Parker made a remark before
which all else that she had said sank into insignificance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Erskine Burnham as I saw her to-day,
seemed to me a very beautiful woman, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
she does not look in the least as she did when a
girl. But her daughter does. At seventeen,
Maybelle is really the image of what her mother
was at that age. I wish so much that you could
see her just now, in all her girlish beauty.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXVI" id="chXVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p class="h3">FOR MAYBELLE&#39;S SAKE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> Burnham stared at her guest with
a look that was not simply bewildered,
it was frightened. What <i>could</i> the woman
mean!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is Maybelle?&quot; she spoke the words
almost fiercely; but her bewildered guest kept
her voice low and gentle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must ask you to forgive me, dear Mrs.
Burnham. I know that my words must seem
very intrusive, perhaps unpardonable; but
indeed I thought I was doing right, and it is for
Maybelle&#39;s sake alone that I have ventured.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The repetition of that name seemed to irritate
Mrs. Burnham. &quot;Will you tell me who she is?&quot;
she asked imperiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My friend, is it possible that you do not
understand? or do you mean that it is your
pleasure to ignore her? Of course you know
that there was a child, a little daughter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&quot;Whose daughter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The daughter of the lady who afterward
became your son&#39;s wife.&quot; Mamie Parker was
growing indignant. However painful the subject
might be to Erskine Burnham&#39;s mother,
certainly the child was not to blame; nor
could she, who was apparently the child&#39;s only
friend, be quite beyond the line of toleration
because she had ventured to try to awaken
sympathy for her in the heart of a woman who
certainly had reason to be interested in her
story. Whatever had taken place to hurt
them, surely the child ought not to suffer
for it.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham struggled for composure.
Even at that moment the thought uppermost
in her mind was that she must shield her son;
yes, and her son&#39;s wife, if possible. Something
terrible had happened somewhere. A confusion
of persons, probably, or&mdash;she could not
think clearly, but there was something, some
story, which she must ferret out to its foundation,
and must at the same time hide from her
son, unless&mdash;she would not complete that
thought.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;You will forgive me I am sure for not being
able to quite follow you.&quot; Her voice though
cold and constrained was again self-controlled,
and she even forced a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I must be unusually stupid this afternoon.
There is some misunderstanding that
I do not yet quite grasp. This&mdash;child? is
she?&mdash;of whom you are speaking, she is not,&mdash;not
alone in the world? Why does she especially
need a friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Parker&#39;s bewildered look returned; they
were not getting on. She hesitated a moment,
then said firmly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her father is still living, Mrs. Burnham, but
he is seriously ill, and she will soon be quite
alone. At the best, the father, as you probably
know, is not the kind of friend that one
would choose for a young girl, though he has
tried to be good to her, in his way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burnham suddenly leaned forward and
grasped the arm of her caller, and spoke with
more vehemence than before, though this time
her voice was low.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she said. &quot;Isn&#39;t it
possible for you to speak plainly? How should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
I know what you are talking about? Her
&#39;<i>father</i>&#39;! Whose father? Who is she? What
is she? And what are either of them to me? I
do not understand in the least.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham,&quot; said Mamie Parker, sitting
erect, with a bright spot of color burning on
either cheek, &quot;do you mean me to understand
that you are ignorant of the fact that your son
married a woman who was divorced from her
first husband in less than three years after her
marriage, and left with him a little child not
six months old, who is now a young woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was well for Ruth Burnham that she could
do just what she did at that moment, although
it was for her an unprecedented thing. Every
vestige of self-control gave way; she covered
her face with her hands and broke into a perfect
passion of weeping. Not the slow quiet
weeping natural to a woman of her years, but
a tempestuous outburst that shook her whole
frame with its force.</p>

<p class="indent">The distressed witness of this misery sat for
a moment irresolute, then she came softly to
Mrs. Burnham&#39;s side and touched the bowed
head with a gentle, caressing movement such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
as one might give to a little child, and spoke
low and tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear friend, forgive me; I am so sorry! I
did not for a moment imagine that I was telling
you anything that you did not already know.
I felt my rudeness in coming to you with matters
about which I was supposed to know nothing,
but I thought you had, perhaps, been misinformed,
and that if you could once understand,
poor Maybelle would&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she stopped. There seemed nothing
that she could say, while that bowed form was
shaken with emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">It passed in a few minutes. The woman who
was accustomed to exercising self-control could
not long be under the dominion of her emotions.
She raised her head and spoke quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you can forgive me for making your
errand so hard. My nerves do not often play
me false in this way. You did right to come
to me. Now, may I ask you to begin at the
beginning and tell me all that you know about
this matter? You are correct in your inference;
there are some things that I have not understood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
It was rather a long story. Miss Parker,
feeling herself dismissed from the place of comforter,
went back to her chair and tried to obey
directions and begin at the beginning; held
closely to her work by keen incisive questions.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, she had known Mr. Somerville before
he married Irene Carpenter; or rather, she had
known of him, as girls in country villages always
knew about any people who came their way.
He was an Englishman of good family, a younger
son she had heard, though just what significance
attached to that, she had not understood at the
time. He had the name among the young
people of being wild. They had heard that
Irene&#39;s uncle disapproved of the match, and
threatened to lock her up if she tried to have
anything more to do with him. She, Mamie,
knowing something of Irene&#39;s temperament,
had always thought that this was what precipitated
matters. She knew that Irene was married
during her uncle&#39;s absence from home, and
that there were some exciting scenes after his
return.</p>

<p class="indent">The newly married couple went abroad very
soon, but they stayed only a short time, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
rumor had it that they quarrelled with Mr.
Somerville&#39;s family and were not invited to
stay longer. After that, they lived in New York
in good style for a few months, and Mrs. Somerville
went into society and was said to be
very gay. Yes, she had heard a number of
things about that winter, but the stories were
contradictory and not reliable. Oh, yes, some
of the stories were ugly, but gossip was always
that; she could not go into details about that
period; there was nothing reliable, and nothing
that she cared to talk of. It was when the child
was about six months old that her father and
mother quarrelled and separated. Oh, yes,
there was a divorce; she had made an effort to
discover the truth about that, for the little girl&#39;s
sake, and was sure of it. The mother went
abroad with some friends and remained there
for several years.</p>

<p class="indent">She had heard that she served as nursery
governess in an American family who were
living in Berlin, for the purpose of educating
their sons. She knew that this was so, because
she had met one of the sons, later, and he had
told her about her; she went by the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
Carpenter&mdash;Miss Carpenter. After leaving that
family, Miss Parker did not know what she had
done; knew nothing of her for several years.
Then she came back to the old homestead and
lived there for some time with a maiden aunt
who was all that was left of the family, and was
an invalid. She had heard that Irene was not
contented there, and knew that after a time she
and the invalid aunt went abroad. It was while
they were living in Paris that Mr. Erskine Burnham
met them. Miss Parker had heard of his
marriage almost immediately, because she had
friends in Paris at the time who had met both
Miss Carpenter and Mr. Burnham. Indeed all
these items had come to her from time to time
by a series of accidents or happenings. She
had admired Irene Carpenter at a distance as a
girl, and that had made it seem natural to inquire
after her, as opportunity offered.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, yes, she had known more or less of Mr.
Somerville during all these years. He had
remained in New York much of the time;
though he had twice crossed the ocean, and once
had gone to the Pacific coast, always taking
Maybelle with him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
Her first meeting with him in New York had
been at the studio of an artist friend for whom
he was doing some work. She had seen the
child first, a beautiful little girl who had charmed
her; then he had come in and she had been
shocked on recognizing him, to think that she
must have been playing with Irene&#39;s little girl.
He was an amateur artist, never working steadily
enough to make a success for himself, but
doing very good work, and earning his living in
that way. Oh, yes, and in music also, it was
much the same story. He was in frail health,
was unsteady, and could not be depended upon;
but could play divinely when he chose, and on
occasion earned money in that way, playing the
violin, or piano, or organ. He always took the
child with him and seemed devoted to her,
never speaking other than gently to her; and
he seemed to try to train her wisely. It was
pathetic to see him making an effort to fill the
place of both father and mother. Oh, yes,
she saw a great deal of him, or rather, of the
child, in whom she had been singularly interested
from the first, of course.</p>

<p class="indent">Her father had moved his family to New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
about that time, and she was in school as a real
student for the first time in her life. But she
gave most of her leisure to the little Maybelle.
Her mother became very fond of the child, and
after a while they kept her with them much of
the time, to the great comfort of the father, who
owned that he often had to go to places where
he did not like to take the baby.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, she came to know the father quite well.
Maybelle had been allowed always to suppose
that her mother was dead. She never questioned,
having taken that for granted. Her
father, however, during one of his ill turns when
he thought he was going to die, had revealed to
her mother and herself the sorrowful story of
his life, and had shown them Irene&#39;s picture.
Miss Parker believed that he had a faint hope
that when he was gone, the mother would see
that their child was cared for.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, he had told her only the truth. She
had taken pains to corroborate that part of the
story which she had not known before; had
gone herself to see the woman with whom they
had been boarding when his wife left him. The
woman said that Mr. Somerville had come home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
intoxicated the night before; &quot;not bad,&quot; the
poor creature said, &quot;only silly,&quot; but the next
morning he and his wife had quarrelled, and
she went away and never came back.</p>

<p class="indent">Being closely cross-questioned Miss Parker
added, that the woman had further given it as
her opinion that Mrs. Somerville meant all
along to be &quot;that shabby,&quot; and was only waiting
for a good excuse; that she didn&#39;t care a
&quot;toss up&quot; for her husband, nor the baby
neither, though he &quot;just doted&quot; on both of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, Miss Parker had talked with him more
than once about his sad, wrecked life. She
considered him a weak man rather than an
intentionally wicked one. He had never spoken
ill of his wife. He said frankly that their
marriage was a mistake, and that it was his
fault. Irene was too young to be married to
any one, but he was fascinated with her, and
determined to win her at any cost. The truth
was, he said, he cheated her. She was tired of
her humdrum life in that dull village where her
people spent much of their time; she longed to
get away, to travel; above all she wanted to go
abroad. She had inferred that, because he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
from across the water, and belonged to an old
family and could show her pictures of a fine old
estate that had been in the family for generations,
he was therefore wealthy; and he had let
her think so. It was the discovery that she had
been deceived in this respect, he said, that made
her begin to really dislike him, he thought, instead
of being simply indifferent to him, as she
had been at first. He made no pretence of
believing that she had ever loved him.</p>

<p class="indent">No, he could not say that she had ever seemed
to love the child. At first she had been angry
about it, looking at it merely in the light of a
hindrance to the few pleasures she could have,
cooped up in a boarding-house; and the strongest
feeling she had ever shown for the helpless
little creature was toleration.</p>

<p class="indent">When they quarrelled, and she threatened to
leave him, he had told her that she could not
take the baby, and she had replied that it was
the last thing she wanted to do. But he had
not believed her; he had not thought such a
state of mind possible. The little thing, he
said, had so wound itself about his heart that
the thought of living without her was torture;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
and he had believed that the mother felt the
same, but did not choose to own it. He had
taken the baby to a friend of his for the day,
and felt secure all day in the thought that Irene
would be drawn homeward from wherever she
went that morning, by the memory of the clinging
arms and smiling baby face. But she had
never come back.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Ruth Erskine Burnham lost her
studied self-control and said the only unguarded
word that she had spoken since the interview
began.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is monstrous! I cannot credit it.
The woman who would do such a thing as that
would be a fiend!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; said Miss Parker, startled at the
feeling she had roused, and remembering that
they were speaking of this woman&#39;s son&#39;s wife.
&quot;He did not feel it so, the father. He made
excuses for her. Even while he was telling me
the story, he stopped to say simply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You see I didn&#39;t stop to consider that she
disliked and despised me, by this time, and that
the baby was my child; that made all the
difference in the world;&#39; and of course it would,
Mrs. Burnham.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXVII" id="chXVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p class="h3">BUILT ON THE SAND</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;Your</span> mother has had a very special guest
of some sort and was closeted with her
all the afternoon; I suppose she is tired out;
she looked so when I met her in the hall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was Mrs. Erskine Burnham&#39;s explanation
to her husband of his mother&#39;s absence
from the dinner table. They had waited for
her a few minutes, then sent a maid to her room,
who had reported that Mrs. Burnham was tired
and did not care for dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine, on hearing it, had made a movement
to rise, a troubled look on his face, and then had
waited for his wife&#39;s word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A guest in her own room? That is unusual
for mother, isn&#39;t it? Who was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How should I know? I wasn&#39;t enlightened.
When I reached home soon after luncheon, I
asked Nannie who had been here, and among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
others she mentioned a young lady who had
asked very particularly to see &#39;Madame Burnham,&#39;
and said that after a while she took the
lady to her own sitting room, and she was there
yet. She left but a few minutes before you came,
a very stylish-looking person, indeed, and quite
young. It is fortunate that she did not stay
for dinner, as I supposed she would, having spent
the day, or I might have been seized with a fit
of jealousy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you say my mother looked worn?
Were you in her room?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed! I did not presume; I all but
ran against her in the hall, and thought she
looked older than usual.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She may have had some unpleasant news;
I think I will run up and see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t, Erskine! I am sure you annoy
your mother by such watchfulness. Old people
don&#39;t like that sort of care, it seems to them like
spying upon their movements; they want a
chance to do as they please. I found that out
from auntie; she seemed really annoyed when
I questioned her about her movements. She
wanted to be left to come to her dinner, or stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
away, as she pleased; and your mother is just
like her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine opened his lips to speak, then closed
them again. He was on the verge of saying that
he could not think of two people more unlike
than his mother and her aunt; then it occurred
to him that to make a remark so manifestly
in favor of his own relative would hardly be
courteous. Of course Irene thought of her aunt
much as he did of his mother, and besides, the
aunt was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">But he did not go up to his mother. It is
true that he told his wife, presently, that he
could not think for a moment that his care of
and solicitude for his mother would ever look
to her like espionage; they understood each
other too well for that; but he spoke in a
troubled tone. Despite this perfect understanding,
his wife&#39;s constancy to the belief that his
mother was growing old, and more or less feeble,
and whimsical, as she believed old people
always did, was having its effect upon him;
he was beginning to feel at times that perhaps
he did not understand his mother, after all.</p>

<p class="indent">It was well for his peace of mind that he did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
not go to her just then; for the first time in his
life he would have been refused admittance to
his mother&#39;s room. Ruth Erskine Burnham had
shut herself away as much as she could from her
outside world, and was fighting the battle of her
life. A wild temptation was upon her, so strong
that in its first strength she could not have resisted
it, had she tried, and she did not try. It
was so transformed that it did not appear to
her as a temptation, but as a duty. Erskine&#39;s
wife had deceived him; not once, in a crucial
moment, but steadily, deliberately, continuously.
Not only had she posed for him as a widow,
but she had given him vivid pictures of her girlish
desolation in her widowhood. His mother
knew this, for Erskine had reproduced some of
them in a few delicate touches, with the evident
object of awakening in her a tender sympathy
for one who, though so young, had suffered
much.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young!&quot; indeed! she had even stooped to
the low and petty deception of making herself
out to be much younger than she was! could an
honorable man condone such small and unnecessary
meannesses as that? Especially in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
wife! And Erskine was married to her. Erskine
of all men in the world the husband of a
divorced woman! And he was on record in
the public journals as one who had denounced
with no gentle tongue the whole system of legal
divorce as permitted in this country; he had
characterized it as unrighteous and infamous.
Young as he was, he had made himself felt in
legal circles along this very line, and was recognized
as a strong advocate for better laws and
purer living.</p>

<p class="indent">So pronounced had he been on this whole
subject that certain of his brother lawyers who,
in the main, agreed with his views, did not
hesitate to tell him that he was too severe, and
was trying to accomplish the impossible. His
mother, in the light of her recently acquired
knowledge, laughed, a cruel laugh, then shivered
and turned pale over the memory of a recent
conversation which had now grown significant.</p>

<p class="indent">The pastor of their church, Mr. Conway&#39;s
successor, was dining with them, and the talk
had turned for a moment on the recent marriage
of one of the parties in a famous divorce
suit. Erskine had declared that if he were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
clergyman, he should consider it his privilege
as well as duty to anticipate the law that was
surely coming and refuse to perform the marriage
ceremony for a divorced person.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, now, brother Burnham,&quot; the clergyman
had said, good naturedly, after a brief, keen argument
on both sides: &quot;Don&#39;t you really draw
the lines too closely? You are not reasonable.
Do you think he is, Mrs. Burnham?&quot;&mdash;the
appeal was to Erskine&#39;s wife&mdash;&quot;You see you
have made no allowance for accidents, or misunderstandings
of any sort. What would you
have a poor woman do who was caught as an
acquaintance of mine was, a year or so ago?
She married a divorced man without having the
remotest idea that he had ever been married
before, and did not discover it until six months
afterward. Where would those sweeping assertions
you have been making place her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine had not smiled as he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was not speaking, of course, of people who
had been the victims of cruel deception; certainly
if I believed in divorce, I should consider
that the woman you mention had sufficient
cause.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;Because she had been deceived!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For just that reason. At least it must be
terrible for a woman to spend her life with a
man whose word she cannot trust. I should
think it would be just ground for separation if
anything is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother recalled not only the energy of his
tones, but the suddenness with which his wife
introduced another topic.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there flashed upon her the memory of
the clergyman&#39;s next remark, addressed to her:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham, is your daughter always as
pale as she is to-day, or has our near approach to
a quarrel, just now, frightened her?&quot; Whereupon
the color had flamed into Irene&#39;s face until
her very forehead was flushed; and Erskine,
looking at her, had said gayly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My wife always blushes when she is the
subject of conversation.&quot; What terrible significance
attached to all these trifles now!</p>

<p class="indent">But, worse than all else, the woman had
deserted and disowned her own child! So
impossibly preposterous did this seem to Erskine
Burnham&#39;s mother, that although she
had detained her guest until a late hour, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
questioned and cross-questioned, and insisted
upon yet more proof, and been shown that there
was not a possibility of error, she still shrank
from it as something that could not be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can a mother forget her child?&quot; It was
the question of inspiration, designed to show
the almost impossibility of such a thing; yet
inspiration had answered, &quot;Yes, she may!&quot;
and here, under their own roof, was a living proof
of its truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>How</i> could she! How <i>could</i> she!&quot; The
mother-nature continually went back to that
awful question. Suppose she had not? Suppose
she had taken the child away with her,
and mothered it all these years, and, at last,
Erskine had married her? Then he would have
stood in the place of father to that girl, and she
would have been taught to call him so! His
poor mother shivered as though in an ague chill
as the strange, and to her appalling, details of
this life-tragedy pressed upon her. A tragedy
all the more terrible and bewildering because
they had been&mdash;some of them&mdash;living it
unawares.</p>

<p class="indent">The possibility that Erskine might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
knowledge of this appalling story did not, even
for a moment, occur to his mother. She knew
him too well for that. Erskine had been deceived,
fearfully deceived! not only in great
and terrible ways, as one under awful provocation,
but in petty details,&mdash;as to her age, for instance;
and that this was merely an instance,
Ruth knew only too well.</p>

<p class="indent">By slow degrees the conviction had been
forced upon this truth-loving woman that she
had for a daughter one to whom the truth was
as a trifle to be trampled upon a dozen times
a day if the fancy seized her.</p>

<p class="indent">Numberless instances of this had been thrust
upon a close observer. &quot;Yes,&quot; she would say
unhesitatingly and unblushingly to Erskine,
when his mother knew that &quot;No&quot; would have
been the truth. Even the servants had learned
to smile over this peculiarity in their young
mistress, and to make efforts to have witnesses
for any of her orders that were important.
With the outside world she was so unpardonably
careless of her word that Mrs. Burnham was almost
growing used to apologizing for and blushing
over her daughter&#39;s society inaccuracies.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
Given a woman like Ruth Erskine Burnham,
belonging to a family in whom, generations
back, there had been martyrs for the truth&#39;s
sake, trained from her very babyhood to despise
every false way, self-trained, through the
years, to hold with almost painful insistence to
whatever she had seemed to promise, perhaps
no other fault would have been harder to condone
in others. She was still struggling to try
to love her daughter-in-law, but she knew that
she had ceased to respect her.</p>

<p class="indent">It was this condition of things which had
made it possible for her to credit Miss Parker&#39;s
story. Since Irene&#39;s moral twist with regard
to truth was most apparent, why should she be
expected to spurn the thought of other immoralities?</p>

<p class="indent">It was while Ruth Burnham was at this stage
of her mental confusion that the temptation of
her life came to her, clad in the white robes of
truth and honor. It came, of course, by way of
Erskine. He must know the whole blighting
story and must know it at once. He must be
told that the woman whom he had blessed with
his love and whom he was tenderly sheltering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
from a rude world was a woman who could
trample upon marriage vows, desert her first-born
child, and lie about it all in a colossal
manner; not only once, at first, but through
the years! The whole fearful structure of
Erskine&#39;s later life, built as it was upon falsehood,
must be made to tumble about him in
ruins. What a cruel thing! Erskine, the soul
of honor, with as keen a love for truth as it was
possible for human being to have, must, in
spite of himself, be involved in the meshes of
this false and cruel life! And yet, underneath
the groan which she had for his ruined home
and his ruined hopes, was a faint little thrill of
exultation.</p>

<p class="indent">When Erskine must cease to respect his wife,
he could not continue to love her with the kind
of love that he was giving to her now. At the
best it could be only a pitying, protecting love,
and there was a sense in which she, his mother,
would have him back again, at least to a degree.
No one knew better than herself that there was
a sense in which she had lost him.</p>

<p class="indent">What would he be likely to do? Irene was
his wife, and he would do his duty at whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
cost, but just what was his duty? She tried to
settle it for him. There was the child, the young
woman rather, Irene&#39;s daughter. Would he not
insist that the mother should do her tardy duty
toward the child? But what was the duty of
such a mother toward such a child? And how
could anything be arranged for now, under such
strange, such startling circumstances? She did
not know. She could not plan, could not think;
Erskine would have to do the thinking; but in
the meantime, where would a boy, trained as
he had been, turn naturally for sympathy but
to his mother? She would have him again!
She exulted in the thought; even then, in her
first recoil from sin and its consequences, she
exulted.</p>

<p class="indent">And then&mdash;just in that moment of exultation&mdash;she
began to realize what she was doing,
and a kind of terror of herself came upon her.
Was it possible that she was really that despicable
thing, a creature so full of self, and selfish
loves, as to be able to thrill with joy, in the very
midst of a ruin that involved her best and dearest,
merely because out of it she was to gain
something?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
It was a terrible night. Mrs. Burnham kept
her door close locked, though Erskine came
once, and again, to seek admittance and went
away puzzled and pained: locked out from
his mother&#39;s room for the first time. She called
out to him, trying to speak reassuringly, that
she was not ill, only unusually tired; she was
in bed, and did not feel equal to getting up to
let him in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, mommie,&quot; he said, &quot;I did not know
that you ever locked your door at night&mdash;not
when we are together. What if you should be
ill in the night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She would not be ill, she told him, and she
really could not get up now and unlock the door.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that he went away with an anxious
heart, and that he came on tiptoe several
times during the night and listened; and she
hated herself for her apparent selfishness.
But she could not let him in, she was not ready
yet for the questions he would be sure to ask.
She had not been able to plan how to make
known to him her terrible secret.</p>

<h2><a name="chXVIII" id="chXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p class="h3">JUSTICE OR MERCY?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was just as the silver-tongued clock on
her mantel was tolling one, that the suggestion
was suddenly made to Ruth Erskine
Burnham that she was planning wickedness.
Instead of trying to arrange how to break
the dreadful news to Erskine, ought she not to
be planning how to avoid having him know
anything about it? Two very unreconcilable
statements were in her mind clamoring to be
heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course she must tell him!&quot; &quot;No, she
must <i>not</i> tell him!&quot; &quot;He ought to be told!&quot;
&quot;He ought <i>not</i> to be told!&quot; These in varying
forms repeated themselves in her brain until
she was bewildered. And the contradictory
argument continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That girl, that forsaken, disowned girl&mdash;justice
to her demanded the telling.&quot; &quot;Justice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
did no such thing!&quot; &quot;But Irene was her
mother, and had duties toward her that could
not be ignored.&quot; &quot;Irene was her mother only
in name; there was no sense in which she could,
even though she wished to do so, take the
place of mother to her now.&quot; &quot;Do not you
know,&quot; continued that other voice speaking
to the stricken woman, &quot;do not you feel sure
that for a young girl to be brought under the
direction and daily influence of such a woman
as Irene, would be almost the worst fate that
could befall her?&quot; &quot;But Erskine has a duty
toward her; he ought&mdash;&quot; &quot;Erskine <i>cannot</i>!
you know he cannot. Have you not daily
proof of the limit of his influence over Irene?
Do you not know to your grief that in some
matters she dominates him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Erskine ought to know the kind of
woman that he is harboring. It is horrible to
have him go on loving and trusting her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such knowledge coming to Erskine now,
could work only harm. He has done no wrong;
his conscience is clear, his hands are clean.
Simply to reveal to him the former sins of the
woman he has promised to love and cherish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
would be to plunge him into depths of misery,
without accomplishing anything for either the
girl or his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Irene ought to be exposed; she ought
to repent, and confess her sin; it is monstrous
to go on helping her to cover it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have nothing to do with Irene&#39;s
&#39;oughts.&#39; You cannot make her either confess
or repent. To &#39;cover&#39; her sin, as you
call it, will not change the moral conditions
for her in any way, it will simply bring unutterable
pain and shame upon your son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But ought not sin to be exposed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always. Sometimes to cover sin is
God-like. Think, if you can, of one helpful,
hopeful result which might reasonably be expected
to follow such an exposure as you contemplate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a long-drawn-out controversy; as
real to Ruth as though her soul had separated
itself from that other mysterious part of her
which was yet not her body, and stood confronting
her, calm, strong, unyielding. She
tossed on her bed from side to side, and turned
and re-turned her pillows, and straightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
the disordered bedclothing, and sought in vain
for an hour of rest. At times she resolutely
told herself that she would put it all aside
until morning, and wait, like a reasonable being,
until her brain was clear and she was capable
of reaching conclusions; then she would compose
herself for sleep, only to find that she was
taking up each minute detail of the story that
had been told her and living it over again.
She could not even interest herself in any of
the side issues save for a few minutes at a time.
She tried hard to centre her thoughts about
the woman, Miss Parker, and contrast her with
that crude disappointing girl by the same
name that she had met years before; it did not
seem to her that they could be one and the
same! What a beautiful woman in every
sense of the word this Miss Parker was! What
if she, Erskine&#39;s mother, had been gifted with
foresight, in those early years, had been able
to conceive of the possibilities hidden in that
uncouth, silly country girl, and had encouraged
in Erskine the interest which she then awakened?
Or, failing in that, what if she had
simply kept her hand off and let things take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
their course? Would this woman with her
beautiful face and gracious ways and cultivated
mind and heart have become Erskine&#39;s wife,
and her daughter? How extraordinary that
it should have been Mamie Parker who had
touched her life again, when she had labored
so hard to be free from her, and had succeeded!
And it was Mamie Parker who had come to
the rescue of a desperately friendless girl who
ought at this moment to be sheltered in their
own home! And then she was back in the
meshes of it all again!</p>

<p class="indent">She arose at length and began to move softly
about her room through the darkness. She
must stay in the darkness, otherwise Erskine
might discover a light and insist upon being
admitted. Very softly she drew back her
curtains and looked out upon the moonless
night. There were countless stars, but they
gleamed from far away and looked even more
indifferent than usual to what was going on
below them. Softly she drew a chair beside
the open casement and sat down to try the
effect of the cool night air upon her throbbing
head. If she could only get quiet enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
think! But those two conflicting thoughts were
still pounding away in her brain: &quot;Erskine
must be told.&quot; &quot;Erskine must <i>not</i> be told!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet she made progress, and a discovery.
It was beginning to humiliate her to the very
dust to discover that there was a sense in which
she wanted to tell him! No, not that, either;
but she wanted him to know; and she wanted
this because she desired to have Irene dethroned!</p>

<p class="indent">There were no tears shed during those hours.
The victim had gone beyond tears. Her throat
felt dry and parched and her eyes burned, as
one in a fever. She was beginning to realize
that this might be a conflict between right and
wrong, and that her own personality was engaged
in it. The clock struck two, struck
three, and still that mother sat gazing out on
the singularly quiet night. Twice during that
time she heard Erskine come with soft footsteps,
evidently to listen at her door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma,&quot; he said, speaking low, but so distinctly
that she knew he reasoned that if she
were awake she would certainly hear him.
It seemed to her that he must hear the throbbing
of her heart as she waited. A wild desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
possessed her to fling wide the door and bid
him come in and listen while she said to him:
&quot;The woman you have taken to your heart, to
love and cherish forever, is false to the truth,
false to every sense of honor, false even to her
own child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She clutched at the arms of her chair, to
keep her, and held her breath that it make no
sound.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine went on tiptoe back to his room,
and his mother, who had almost spent her
physical strength, sank limply back into her
chair. But before the clock struck again she
had got to her knees. All the while she had
been conscious of a strange reluctance about
going to God with this trouble. Accustomed
as she was, and had been ever since she became
a praying woman, to taking all things, small
as well as great, to Him, it had seemed strange
even to herself that she held back.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that she had said that she would not
pray, she had simply shrunken back with a
half-frightened &quot;Not yet, I am not ready yet;
let me think.&quot; But she reached the moment
when she understood that she must have help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
and must have it at once, and that only God
could give it.</p>

<p class="indent">She knelt long; at first speaking no words,
not thinking words. Then she broke into short,
half-sobbing ejaculations: &quot;Lord, show me
the way. Christ, son of Mary, son of God,
help me!&quot; And then the habit of years asserted
itself and the sorely shaken woman entered
wholly within the refuge and poured out her
soul in prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">When she arose from her knees, the rosy tints
of a new day were beginning to flush the east.
She drew her shades and went back to her bed
and slept. Some things had been settled for
her; she need not think about them any more.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman who a few hours later appeared
at the breakfast table in a white morning dress
and with her hair carefully arranged, showed
little trace of her night&#39;s vigil, though her son
regarded her searchingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am thankful to see you here,&quot; he said. &quot;I
was quite worried about you last night. It is
so unusual not to meet you at dinner and have
a little chat with you. You did not even give
a fellow a chance to say good-night! I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
sure that something was wrong.&quot; His wife
laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine cannot get away from the idea that
he is his mother&#39;s nursemaid,&quot; she said lightly.
&quot;And he is a real &#39;Miss Nancy&#39; for worrying.
Such a night as he gave me, merely because
you did not choose to come down to dinner!
He must have trotted out to your door to listen
twenty times, at least.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twice, anyway,&quot; said Erskine, gayly.
&quot;Never mind, though; she is all right this
morning, and that is more than I dared to hope.&quot;
But he watched her closely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What tired you so, mamma? Or rather,
who did? Irene said you had company all
the afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, an old acquaintance. I don&#39;t think
you could guess who it was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at least without seeing her. Was she
also an old acquaintance of mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you will remember her; at least
you will, her brother. It was Miss Parker.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Miss Parker?&#39; Not Mamie? How interesting!
Why didn&#39;t you keep her to dinner?
I should like to have met her. Is she &#39;Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
Parker&#39; still, after all these years? That is
rather surprising, isn&#39;t it? She must be thirty
or more. And what about her brother? I
haven&#39;t heard anything of him to speak of,
since I left college.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are these interesting people who seem
to have just sprung into existence again?&quot;
Irene asked. &quot;I have never heard of Mamie
Parker, have I? Is she an old sweetheart of
yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hardly!&quot; Erskine laughed carelessly.
&quot;There was a time during my college life that
her brother and I were rather intimate; then
we drifted apart; he was a good fellow, though.
What about him, mamma?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something that greatly surprised me. Had
you supposed him to be of the material that
makes missionaries? That is what he has
become: a foreign missionary. He went out
to China about seven years ago, purely in a
commercial way. He represented a New York
business house, but he carried letters of introduction
to our missionaries located there, and
became intimate with them and so interested
in their work that, after a time, he gave up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
business entirely and became a missionary
teacher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it possible!&quot; said Erskine. &quot;I think
he is the last one I should have chosen for such
a future; from our class, I mean. Though he
was a fine fellow with a big unselfish heart.
Didn&#39;t I always insist upon that, mamma, in
the days when you did not like him very well?
Weren&#39;t there such days? I have almost
forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I considered him remarkable,&quot;
Mrs. Burnham said. &quot;Though I remember
that Alice saw possibilities in him. She
liked him for being so good to his sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he is really in China! How does his
sister like that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So well that she is going out to be with him
for a year, and perhaps longer. She is in daily
expectation of receiving a summons from a
party of missionaries with whom she is to travel.
She is very enthusiastic about it; sees ways
in which she can further the work. I should
not be at all surprised if she remained there
and made it her life work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine Burnham looked curiously at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
mother, as if to determine whether she was
really in earnest, then threw back his head and
laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamie Parker a missionary in China!&quot;
he exploded, &quot;or anywhere else! my imagination
isn&#39;t equal to such a flight as that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has changed wonderfully, Erskine. At
first I could not make myself believe that she
was really the Mamie Parker we used to know.
Yet as I studied her closely I could see a suggestion
of the girlish face. She was pretty,
you remember, but I did not think her face
gave promise of the beauty it has now. However,
she is more than beautiful. She is an
educated cultivated woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Educated?&quot; Erskine repeated the word
incredulously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She went back to school, Erskine, the winter
after she visited her brother, and prepared for
college. She is a Smith graduate, think of it!
As for culture, I don&#39;t think I ever met a more
perfect-appearing lady than she has become.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me!&quot; said Irene with a but slightly
suppressed yawn, &quot;what a paragon she must
be; I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t meet her. I detest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
paragons. Now, if you, sir, can stop talking
about her long enough to consider it, have the
goodness to tell me at what time I may expect
you in town this afternoon? We are to be at
the Durands&#39; at five, remember. Don&#39;t you
dare to tell me you must be excused, for I have
simply set my heart on having you with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Erskine could not so readily be made to
forget his anxieties. He put off a direct answer
to his wife, and followed his mother to her room
to press his inquiries tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure that you are all right this
morning, and that it was only weariness which
kept you so close a prisoner last night? There
is something about you that I don&#39;t quite like;
there are heavy rings under your eyes, and you
are paler than usual. Did you sleep well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not very,&quot; she said after a moment&#39;s
hesitation. &quot;I was&mdash;restless.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He studied her face and spoke with tender
reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mommie, something troubles you. Am I
not to know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had no recourse but to speak truth.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXIX" id="chXIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p class="h3">ALONE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">She</span> laid a tender motherly hand on his
arm as she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something has been troubling me, Erskine,
something that I cannot explain, because there
is a sense in which it is not my trouble at all,
but has to do with others. For a time I was
very much perplexed, but I have settled it now,
what my share in it should be, so that it need
not perplex me any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that the truth was deceiving him,
but it satisfied him. He believed that Mamie
Parker&#39;s troubles, whatever they were, had
been brought for his mother to share. His face
cleared a little, but he felt it his duty to administer
a loving admonition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remember your one weakness, mamma;
there was always in your nature a temptation
to &#39;bear one another&#39;s burdens&#39; too literally.
If there is any way in which I can help without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
infringing on confidences, you will let me, of
course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was able to smile as she assured him that
she would. Despite her night of vigil she felt
strong. Her part had been revealed to her.
She was to keep Irene&#39;s secret, to suffer and to
act in her stead; and to shield her son&#39;s name
and home as much as lay in her power. A
miserable travesty of a home it looked to her;
still, it was all he had, and for a time at least
it could be kept sacred in Erskine&#39;s eyes. She
had no faith in a perpetual concealment; such
skeletons, she believed, were always unearthed
sooner or later&mdash;often in unexpected and
mysterious ways. How remarkable, for instance,
it was that, of all the young women in
the world who might have discovered and
befriended the deserted child it should have
been their old acquaintance Mamie Parker!
Still, this morning, she could thank God that
she need not be the one to unearth this secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course the child must be planned for&mdash;there
was no danger that Ruth would forget
her&mdash;but it had become very clear to her that
nothing but disaster could result from an enforced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
acknowledgement of her by the mother
at this late day. If Irene wanted her&mdash;if her
heart had turned toward her child in the slightest,
or, failing in heart, if her conscience had
impelled her to make the least small effort to
repair some of the mischief, then, indeed,
Ruth would have braved public opinion, gossip,
Erskine&#39;s pain and shame, everything to help
her. And she could do it understandingly.
Had not Ruth Erskine, away back in her girlhood,
helped her father in his tardy right-doing?</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that, even at this late day, her face
flushed with pain and shame over the thought
of the manner in which she had done this, at
first; still, she had done it. And later, had she
not herself taken the initiative and opened the
way for her husband to do his belated duty?
Who could know better than she the cost of such
effort? But there was one infinite difference
between past experiences and present problems.
Both her father and her husband, when the
crucial test came, had a foundation of moral
strength to build upon; while Irene&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Burnham knew that she had tried very
hard to find some lighting up of the story.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
She had thoroughly probed Mamie Parker to
discover whether or not through the years the
mother had made some sign which proved that
she at least knew of the continued existence
of her daughter; but there had been absolutely
no proof that she had ever thought of her six
months&#39; old baby again! Ruth had to turn
quickly away from that subject as one that
would not bear dwelling on. The idea that a
mother had actually and deliberately abandoned
her baby, roused such a sense of revolt
in this woman&#39;s heart that there were times
when she told herself that she could not breathe
in the same house with such a creature.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Parker herself had seemed able to appreciate
this feeling. At least she had given no
hint that she expected or hoped anything whatever
from the mother, and frankly owned that
she had avoided meeting her on occasions when
there would have been opportunity. She had
not felt, she said simply, that anything could
be gained by coming in contact with her. And
all her plea had been that Erskine&#39;s mother
should in some way interest herself in the welfare
of the lonely girl.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
She was very lonely, now, more so by far than
she used to be, Miss Parker had said in a voice
that trembled. Then she had waited a few
minutes to regain self-control before she explained
that her mother had to a very great
extent taken the place of mother to the little one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She used to spend her vacations with us,&quot;
she said, &quot;and mother fell into the habit of
looking after her clothes and her comfort in
every way, just as though she were a daughter;
and the child loved mother with a devotion
that is uncommon in one so young. Of course
she cannot but miss her sadly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you lately lost your mother?&quot; Ruth
had inquired, and her tone had been so full of
tender sympathy that Miss Parker had explained
in detail how it was that she had only
her brother left. That was why she was going
out to him, so that they might be together, at
least for a time, since they were all that was
left of home.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim had not married; his sister sometimes
feared that he never would. Didn&#39;t Mrs. Burnham
think that was a calamity for a man?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to think so,&quot; Ruth had replied, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
one who did not realize that she was speaking
aloud, and then she had started and flushed
over the thought of what she might thus be
revealing; and the flush had deepened as she
remembered what this woman already knew
of her son&#39;s wife. But Miss Parker had not
once glanced in her direction, and made no
sign that she had heard. She went on, quietly,
talking about her brother. Men, she thought,
were different in that respect from women.
A woman need never marry in order to be comfortable,
or to be cared for; but there were
ways in which the average man was helpless
and almost homeless without the one woman
to care for him, selected from all the world.
This was so different from the usual putting of
the subject that Mrs. Burnham had felt impelled
to smile. Yet as she looked at the beautiful
woman opposite her she admitted that her
brother&#39;s home would certainly be brightened
by her presence. Still, it was a long way to
go to make a home for a brother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you have any thought of remaining
there,&quot; she had asked. &quot;I mean, of making
it a permanent home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
Miss Parker did not know. She had not
allowed herself to look ahead very far. There
were so many changes in life that it did not
seem wise to try to plan. She should like to
remain there, like it very much, she believed;
that is, if she could help in the work. She was
sure that she could help Jim; at least, she could
take care of him, and give him more time to do
his work; and Jim was a success. Still, there
were times when she was sorry that she had
planned in this way, on Maybelle&#39;s account.
Even now, if she could make a change, could
delay a little, without incommoding her brother,
she would do so; but Jim had made plans in
view of her coming that would seriously inconvenience
him if she did not go.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, there had been changes, sad changes
since her plans were made. Mr. Somerville,
who was a frail man and hopelessly careless
of himself, had contracted a cold, a few months
ago, that had settled on his lungs; and it was
now evident to all but that poor little girl that
she would, before long, be fatherless.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, she would be cared for, no doubt, so far
as her body was concerned. She was at school,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
and it was a good school, as good, perhaps, as
any of them. At least she, and her mother, had
been at infinite pains to discover it; still, it was
school, and not home, and poor Maybelle had
never been quite happy there. The teachers
were kind, but cold and unsympathetic. They
did not understand the child, and they almost
openly disapproved of her father. He went
every day to see her, but the time was coming
when he would no longer be able to do so, and
she dreaded to think what Maybelle would do
when this truth dawned upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">In these and many other ways had Miss Parker
made it apparent to Mrs. Burnham that her
hope lay in winning the woman who had been
so much to her, to become this deserted and
lonely child&#39;s friend and guardian.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the problem therefore which occupied
Ruth Burnham&#39;s chief thought for a number
of days following Miss Parker&#39;s visit. Only
one decision with regard to it had been reached:
that she would do what she could; but what
that would be, she was unable to determine.
Her way seemed hedged in with difficulties
which had not occurred to her during those first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
awful hours. How, for instance, was she, a
stranger, with no claim to other than a stranger&#39;s
interest that she could press, to present herself
before a young woman who was under the care
of her own father, and beg to be taken as a
friend and adviser?</p>

<p class="indent">Then, too, she shrank exceedingly from meeting
the father; meeting and talking with a
man who had been Irene&#39;s husband! his very
presence on the earth seemed an insult to her
son! What explanation could she possibly
make to him as to her interest in his daughter?
Would her name tell him anything? What
did he know of the after history of the mother
of his child? If he was acquainted with her
present name, might he not look upon the coming
of her husband&#39;s mother as an added insult?
For, after all, he was a decent man, decent
enough for a woman like Mamie Parker to
acknowledge his acquaintance; and he had
done what he could for his deserted child.
She could not even find that he had been seriously
to blame for the child&#39;s desertion; therefore
he might well resent this tardy coming to
his aid.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Going back step by step over her interview
with Miss Parker, Ruth found that there were
many questions which she had failed to ask;
and among them was this important one as to
the father&#39;s knowledge of Irene&#39;s present name
and home. It seemed almost necessary to
wait and write to Miss Parker before attempting
anything. Yet she shrank morbidly from
this; it seemed like opening the whole horror
afresh.</p>

<p class="indent">If there were actual need on the part of the
girl, such as could be met by money, her way
would have been clearer. But of this she had
thought at once, and Miss Parker had almost
dignifiedly declined her help.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Mrs. Burnham, I consider it my privilege
to look after Maybelle in all such ways;
we have done it for years, mother and I together,
and now it seems almost like her trust to me.
It has been a real comfort to see that the child
was provided with such little luxuries of the
toilet, for instance, as I longed for and could
not have. We were much straitened in my
girlhood, and I have been living my life over
again in this young girl; though she is much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
less silly than I was. I must not be deprived
of this privilege, Mrs. Burnham; indeed I
have her father&#39;s permission to do for her
whatever I think wise; he trusts me fully; and
I have no one else, now, to think about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So that avenue seemed closed. Ruth, thinking
about it almost irritably as the complications
grew upon her, told herself that it would
have been wiser for Mamie Parker to plan to
stay away from China and attend to all the
rest of it; she could do it better than any one
else.</p>

<p class="indent">She wrote to Miss Parker at last, a careful
letter, re-written several times lest it tell too
much between lines.</p>

<p class="indent">That young woman had evidently taken it
for granted that the Burnham family were
supplied with the main facts in this tragedy,
and had found it hard to rally from her astonishment
at finding the mother in ignorance.
Ruth knew that she believed that Erskine was
not. She longed to tell her that this was
false, yet held her pen. Did not this infringe
upon her solemn covenant with God to shield
her daughter-in-law as much as right would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
permit? Yet, was it right to let her son&#39;s
good name be smirched unnecessarily in the
eyes of this woman who had known him in his
spotless youth?</p>

<p class="indent">At last she wrote this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Since our interview I have been through a
bitter experience trying to decide as to my
duty in certain directions. I believe now that
I have reached a decision, and feel that I am
not called upon to tear down with my own
hands the fair home which my son believes he
has begun to build. He is God&#39;s own servant,
and God will see to it that he understands all
that he must understand. I believe that I
may leave it with Him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She waited eagerly for a reply to this letter;
it came in the form of a telegram.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am to sail on Saturday. My poor little
girl is alone. Father buried yesterday. Have
written.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="chXX" id="chXX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p class="h3">THEY HATED MYSTERY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> Ruth Burnham was settled in a
drawing-room car, surrounded by every
comfort and luxury that money and modern
ideas can furnish for a long journey; and
her son Erskine stood looking down on her with
a face only half satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">It occurred to him as a matter of astonishment
that, with the single exception of her one trip
homeward, after her ministrations to Alice,
and while he was abroad, his mother had not,
since he could remember, taken a journey without
him. And here she was, starting for New
York, and planning for a stay of indefinite
length, while he was remaining at home. He
did not wholly like it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not seem quite right, mamma,&quot;
he said, with a smile that had almost wistfulness
in it. &quot;I am not used to seeing you off, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
know. It seems as though I should be going
along to look after your comfort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have already done that, Erskine; I
am sure a queen could not be more carefully
provided for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you have really no idea when you are
coming home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could not plan for it, dear. Your Aunt
Flossy is a woman of many schemes, you know,
and it is long since I visited her; not since you
and I were there together, years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was always &#39;you and I together,&#39;&quot; he
said, discontentedly, as though he almost resented
this sudden independence of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And this other&mdash;person&mdash;whoever she is,
you will not let her absorb you? I can see
how she will wear you out, without me to
manage for you. She is imperious and selfish, of
course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His mother smiled on him tenderly, and a little
sadly. &quot;How did you learn that, Erskine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, by intuition; or common sense. She
would not expect an entire stranger to take a
long and tiresome journey in her behalf if she
were not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
&quot;I don&#39;t think she knows anything about the
journey, or the stranger, my son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it is all Miss Parker&#39;s fault?&quot; and he
frowned. &quot;She has not grown like her brother;
not as he used to be, at least. Why doesn&#39;t
she stay at home and attend to her own affairs,
since they are of so much importance? That
sounds ugly, I know, but I don&#39;t like to lend you,
mommie, indeed I don&#39;t. You belong to me;
and besides, there seems to be an air of mystery
about the whole matter, and I hate mystery;
at least between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was at that moment that the call of &quot;all
aboard&quot; sounded, and Erskine gave his mother
a hasty last kiss and made flying leaps toward
the platform.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a relief to have him go. His mother
also hated mystery; and despite her attempts
at frankness, no one was more conscious than
she of the part that she had not told.</p>

<p class="indent">She had shown Erskine the telegram and
made at the time the very brief explanation
which it had taken her hours to arrange.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a protégé of Miss Parker&#39;s, Erskine,
for whom she has bespoken my sympathy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
help. The girl is quite alone, her father has
just died; and since I have been long promising
your Aunt Flossy, and they are in the same city,
I think I ought to take this time for my visit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A protégé,&quot; Erskine had repeated with
lifted eyebrows. &quot;A relative? Is she responsible
for her? How can one shift such responsibilities
as that, especially upon a stranger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is not related to Miss Parker,&quot; his mother
had replied, and was glad that at the moment she
had been bending over a drawer, so that her
burning face was partially hidden. If Erskine
only knew whose responsibilities had been
shifted! It was that thought which burned
her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is not!&quot; he had replied in an exclamatory
tone. &quot;Then why in the name of common
sense should she,&quot;&mdash;and then, his mother had
determined what she would say further.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine,&quot;&mdash;her face was still bent over that
bureau drawer&mdash;&quot;the peculiar circumstances
connected with this child were explained to me
by Miss Parker in confidence, and of course I
cannot speak of them; further than to tell you
that she considers the girl as a trust.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; Erskine had said, after waiting a
moment for more words that had not come,
&quot;I don&#39;t half like it, mamma. I am sure of
that; and if it were not for your making this
long-promised visit to Aunt Flossy, I should not
consent to your going. As it is, rushing off at
an hour&#39;s notice, in response to an ordinary
telegram, as though somebody had a right to
order you around, seems absurd. I shall write
to Aunt Flossy not to let your heart run away
with your judgment. I am really afraid you are
being imposed upon, mamma. Remember, we
know nothing about these Parkers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After his mother had watched, with the nervous
tremors with which one watches when all
that one has is jumping from a moving train&mdash;until
Erskine was lifting his hat to her from safe
ground, and her train was gliding away from
him, she drew a deep breath of relief; not only
from that immediate tension, but all the hours
which had preceded it. Every moment since
the arrival of that telegram had been a nervous
strain to her, because of the things that she
must say, and the things that she must not say.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene, especially, had taxed her honesty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
ingenuity to the utmost. From the first moment,
the young woman had been curious and
painstaking in trying to satisfy herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The idea!&quot; she would exclaim. &quot;It seems
to me that is asking a great deal of an old woman;
and Erskine says this Miss Parker is only a passing
acquaintance. What possible claim can she
have on you? Why is she so interested in this
girl? Do you understand it? It looks as
though there was a love affair, somewhere,
doesn&#39;t it? She is an old maid, of course.
You can depend upon it that she was in love
with that girl&#39;s father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a side to this woman which Ruth
in her secret soul called coarse. So far as she
knew, it was a phase of her character that was
never exhibited to Erskine.</p>

<p class="indent">With her fine regard for truth, and her contempt
of anything like subterfuge, Mrs. Burnham
found it hard to satisfy the curious questioner,
and yet keep back that part of the truth
which she must not tell. She could not but be
glad when the strain was over.</p>

<p class="indent">Not once had she mentioned the name of the
girl. It had been a continual terror to her lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
she should be asked it; but though Irene asked
every possible question that might throw light
on the mystery, she had been mercifully preserved
from thinking of names. Mrs. Burnham
had learned from Miss Parker that the
first name, Maybelle, would reveal nothing;
it had been chosen by the father for his still
nameless child, months after the mother&#39;s
desertion; and chosen for no better reason than
that Baby had come in the month of May, and
was a &quot;little beauty.&quot; But the name of Somerville
might at least have startled Irene, had she
heard it; and her mother-in-law determined
that she should not. Having resolved upon
silence as the right course, the more absolute
it could be, the better for all concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was not until the train was fairly under
way, speeding eastward at thirty miles an hour,
that Ruth felt free to draw a long breath and rest
her overstrained nerves. Her mind wandered
back through the years, lured there by the
thought of Flossy. It was years since they two
had been alone together, but just at this time
Flossy&#39;s husband had taken a hurried business
trip abroad.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
&quot;It is really providential that I am at home,&quot;
Flossy had written, in response to her old friend&#39;s
letter, telling that she might soon visit her.
&quot;Evan wanted me to go with him, brief as his
stay is to be; and I should have done so, but
for the illness of a very dear friend who seemed
to need me; to think that if I had gone, I might
have missed you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dear Flossy! what a rarely wise little woman
she had become! astonishing them all, not
by her sweetness,&mdash;they had always been sure of
that,&mdash;but by her strength and skill as a Christian
worker. No young woman left to herself
in a dangerous world could have a safer, more
helpful friend than Flossy Shipley Roberts.
Yet Ruth, even as she thought this comforting
thought, remembered that the duty thrust upon
her of guarding the hateful secrets of others
must prevent her from speaking plainly even to
Flossy.</p>

<p class="indent">However, she found reticence with Flossy
easier than it had been with Irene. Joyfully
glad to get possession of her old friend was Mrs.
Roberts, and athrob with eagerness to hear all
that she had to tell her, and sympathetic about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
the minutest details; yet in nothing did she show
her perfect breeding and rare tact more distinctly
than in the questions that she did not ask, concerning
things that Ruth did not choose to tell.</p>

<p class="indent">She told very little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know, Flossy, I have been planning to
come to you for a long, long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly do!&quot; interrupted Flossy, with
an air that obliged Ruth to stop and laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the reason I am here just at this time
is because a protégé of my friend&mdash;the young
woman who sailed last week for China&mdash;has
just lost her father and is alone in this great
city, so far as relatives or very close friends are
concerned, and I am commissioned to try to
comfort her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I know, dear Ruth, how certainly you
will succeed,&quot; was Mrs. Roberts&#39;s comment and
her only one.</p>

<p class="indent">A little later she asked: &quot;Where do you find
your charge, Ruth? Is she a young girl, did
you say? Delightful! I hope you will let me
help? Oh, no, I must not go with you on your
first visit, of course. One new face at a time
is enough for the poor child to meet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
Ruth blessed her in her heart for the delicate
reserve which would not let her question even
about the woman who had gone to China.
After Irene&#39;s baldly put inference she shrank
from trying to explain Miss Parker&#39;s interest in
the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">It was on the morning after her arrival in
town that Mrs. Burnham sat waiting in the
reception room of a dignified, many-storied
house, which, she told herself, had everywhere
about it the unmistakable boarding-school air.</p>

<p class="indent">She had sent up her card, but was uncertain
how much it would tell, or whether she should be
allowed to see the person on whom she had
called. As matters had turned out it seemed
unfortunate that she had so long delayed her
visit to Mrs. Roberts. If she could have been
introduced here by Miss Parker in person, it
might have been better for all concerned. As it
was, she felt strangely out of place and embarrassed.
She had not been able to decide just
how she would account for her extreme interest
in this stranger. It was especially embarrassing
to remember that she must account for it even
to the girl herself. While she waited, she went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
back in memory to that other waiting, in a
boarding-house parlor, when she had called to
see Mamie Parker. What eventful years had
intervened, and what changes they had wrought!
How mistaken she, Ruth Burnham, had been
about many things, notably her estimate of
Mamie Parker. Had she been able with prophetic
insight to get a vision of the woman
Mamie was to be, would it have made a difference,
a radical difference with all their lives?
Then she flushed to her temples as she remembered
that such thoughts were almost an insult
to her son.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then the door opened and there entered
Madame Sternheim, the head of the &quot;Young
Ladies&#39; Fashionable School.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Sternheim was dignified and correct
in every movement and word, and was as cold
as ice.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, Miss Somerville was with them, of
course. Her poor father had left her in their
charge, and a serious responsibility she found it.
Oh, yes, Miss Parker, before she left, had spoken
of some one by the name of&mdash;of Burnham&mdash;she
referred to the card which she held in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
hand&mdash;who might write, or be heard from in
some way. She seemed not to be at all sure
that any one would call.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, certainly, the circumstances were peculiar
and had been all the time. The poor father&mdash;it
was by no means a pleasant thing to have
to speak plainly of the dead, but it was sometimes
necessary, and perhaps Mrs.&mdash;yes, thank you,
Mrs. Burnham, knew that he was not in every
respect the fit guardian for a young woman?</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, yes, Miss Parker had been most kind,
most attentive; Miss Somerville owed her a
deep debt of gratitude, certainly.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed a strange&mdash;&quot;Providence&mdash;shall
we call it?&quot; that took Miss Parker away to China
at just the time when it would appear that her
self-assumed charge needed her the most. She,
Madame Sternheim, had never professed to
understand the situation. Miss Parker, she
believed, was not even remotely related to the
girl, not even a relative of the relatives&mdash;was
she? Yet her interest in the child and her father
had been unaccountably deep. There had
always seemed to her to be an air of mystery
about the whole matter. Madame Sternheim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
did not like mystery; in fact she might say that
she shrank from it. Did Mrs. Burnham understand
that Miss Parker knew personally any of
the family connection?</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth was angry with herself that she must
blush and almost stammer over so simple a
question.</p>

<p class="indent">No, that was what Madame Sternheim had
been led to infer. The relatives were all in
England, were they not? It seemed strange
that the girl was not to go out to them; but
then, her poor father&mdash;Had Mrs. Burnham
been personally acquainted with the father?
Well, she knew of him probably? which was
perhaps quite enough. Miss Parker&#39;s unaccountable
interest in him was beyond understanding,
until one remembered that no one
could tell on what the human heart would anchor,
especially a woman&#39;s heart. She had
never thought that Mr. Somerville was especially&mdash;but
then he, poor man, was gone; they need
not speak of such things now. And Miss Parker,
too, was gone&mdash;to China! That was unaccountable.
If love for the girl had been what
had prompted her attentions all these years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
why, the poor child was doubly in need of it
now. She had been deeply attached to her
father despite the fact that&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; Madame Sternheim broke off quickly,
as the door slowly opened, to say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here she is, Mrs. Burnham, to speak for
herself.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXI" id="chXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p class="h3">&quot;A STUDY&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A</span> tall, pale girl with delicate features
and great brown eyes and a wealth of
gold-brown hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A study in black and white,&quot; was the phrase
that floated through Ruth&#39;s mind as she looked
at her. The girl was in deep mourning unrelieved
even by a touch of white, and her face
was intensely pale. Yet there was something
about her, a nameless something, that claimed
instant interest, and Mrs. Burnham, who, ever
since she had heard of the girl&#39;s existence, had
been struggling with an unreasonable desire to
hate her, felt instantly drawn toward her. She
felt rather than realized that, whatever might
have been Irene&#39;s appearance in girlhood, the
two had nothing in common now, for her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard your name,&quot; the pale girl said,
much as she might have addressed a book agent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
&quot;but I did not know that you were coming to
New York.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; broke in Madame Sternheim, reproof
in her tone, &quot;I am sure it is very kind in
Mrs.&mdash;yes, Mrs. Burnham to take all this
trouble for your sake. She tells me that she is
not related to you in any way, and it is certainly
quite unusual for strangers to be so kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very kind,&quot; the girl said coldly, and
stood irresolute apparently as to what she should
do or say next; while Ruth, sorry for her and
for herself and unreasonably annoyed with
Madame Sternheim, was at a loss how to proceed.</p>

<p class="indent">The Madame came to her aid, addressing the
young girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do be seated, my dear, and make yourself
at least look comfortable.&quot; There was a strong
emphasis laid upon the word &quot;look&quot; and the
reproof in the tone was still marked, as she continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham will naturally want to have a
talk with you, and learn what little you may be
able to explain to her about this sad matter,
although I am too fully aware that it will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
very unsatisfactory.&quot; Then she turned to
Ruth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With your permission, dear madam, I will
retire and leave my charge in your care for the
present. I assure you it is a great relief to me
to find that there is some one willing to share
with me this heavy responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl turned at this, and with slow, languid
steps preceded the Madame to the door, which
she held open for her to pass, and bowed respectfully
as she did so. Then, waiting until a
turn in the hall hid the lady from sight she carefully
closed the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth, meantime, was watching her with a
half-terrified fascination. She was so calm,
so self-possessed, so utterly without feeling of
any sort, apparently. What was to be said to
her? and what good could come in any way
from that which now began to look like interference?
She was not in the least prepared for
the sudden change which the closing of that door
seemed to make.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl turned with an impetuous movement
and seemed to fly, rather than walk, over the
space between them, and, flinging herself in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
crushed little heap in front of her guest, hid her
face on Mrs. Burnham&#39;s lap and burst into a
passion of weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor little girl!&quot; Ruth said softly, and laid
her hand tenderly on the bowed head. There
seemed no other word that could be spoken until
the storm of weeping had in a degree subsided.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do forgive me!&quot; the child said, after a
minute, but without raising her head. &quot;I did
not mean to cry, I meant to control myself;
I thought I could, through it all, but I am so
wretched! and she&mdash;she freezes me! she
wants me to be resigned, and to remember how
much better off I am than some other girls who
have no one to look after them, and it doesn&#39;t
help me one bit. I am so glad that you have
come! You are Aunt Mamie&#39;s friend, so you
can&#39;t be like Madame Sternheim; and you won&#39;t
tell me that Aunt Mamie isn&#39;t related to me in
the most distant degree and in the nature of
things cannot be, will you? I can see that you
are not like the Madame the least bit in the
world, and I am glad, <i>glad</i>! Oh! I am a very
wicked girl! I ought not to have said that;
she is good, she is <i>very</i> good; and she is patient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
with my faults and follies; and yet&mdash;there are
times when I almost hate her! Oh, dear!
what will you think of me? I don&#39;t act like
this very often; I don&#39;t cry often&mdash;I don&#39;t
cry at all! but now I must, or I shall die!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then followed another outburst of passionate
weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cry as much as you want to, dear child,&quot;
Ruth said. &quot;It is only natural, and will do
you good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the time her hand was moving over the
tumbled masses of hair, making quiet, soothing
passes.</p>

<p class="indent">After a little the girl sat up and brushed away
the tears. &quot;I can&#39;t think what made me,&quot;
she said. &quot;Only you reminded me of Aunt
Mamie, and then&mdash;it all came back. I don&#39;t
know what I am to do; it seems to me that I
cannot live without her, but I have got to; and
without&mdash;everybody. It does seem sometimes
as though there was never another girl in the
world so utterly alone; but Madame Sternheim
says there are, hundreds of them, even in this
city! I am so sorry for them all! I wish they
could die and go to heaven. I wish I could, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
papa. But Madame Sternheim says&mdash;&quot; she
stopped abruptly and struggled for self-control,
and spoke almost fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t tell you what she says about my
father, nor think about it. It isn&#39;t true, and if
it were, she&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth felt a curious feeling of indignation rising
against Mamie Parker. How could she have
deserted this child? so soon, at least, after her
bereavement? Surely she needed her more than
the brother did, who had been alone for years!
Then came a great gust of shame and shook
her heart. Why should Mamie Parker, a
stranger, be expected to show compassion for
this lonely girl when her own family, her own
mother&mdash;But that would not bear thinking
about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor little girl!&quot; she said again, with infinite
tenderness. &quot;Will you take me for a
friend? I will do the best I can to be a true
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; the child said impulsively.
&quot;I am so glad, <i>so glad</i> for you! and only last
night I thought I could never be glad about anything
again! Aunt Mamie had to go, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
at the time appointed. It isn&#39;t like other
journeys, you know; they have to sail when they
are told; missionaries do, I mean. That is,&mdash;oh,
you understand. But Aunt Mamie felt
very badly about leaving me; and she said she
thought you would love me; but of course I
couldn&#39;t see why you should. It isn&#39;t that I
am not cared for, Mrs. Burnham. I have been
with Madame Sternheim for six years and I am
sure that I have every care and attention that a
girl possibly could; she has always made that
plain to me; but&mdash;She did not like papa,
Mrs. Burnham. She never did; and she&mdash;almost
spoke against him, even to me! Could
a girl ever care very much for one who talked
and felt as she did about the dearest, kindest,
most loving papa that ever lived? oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She clenched her hands, and the tears threatened
to choke her; but she put them back with
a strong will, and even faintly smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not cry again,&quot; she said. &quot;Madame
thinks it is wicked. Mrs. Burnham, I wish you
could have known my papa. He was&mdash;I mean
he was not&mdash;oh, I don&#39;t know how to say it;
and I am not sure that I want to say it, ever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
He was good to me always; a girl like me
couldn&#39;t have had a better father; and I don&#39;t
know how to live in this world without him.
It kills me to have to stay all the time among
people who say always; &#39;Your poor father!&#39;
and shake their heads and look as though they
could say volumes of ugly things about him if
they chose. They shall not! I will not have
people talking about my father! the dearest, the
best! a great deal better than the self-righteous
creatures made of icicles that they admire!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth was amazed at the suppressed fury of her
tones, and at her eyes which, but a moment before
dim with weeping, now blazed with indignation.
Evidently the child had passed through
a severe mental strain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t, dear,&quot; she said gently. &quot;No one could
be so cruel as to want to speak against your
father. I am glad you love him so dearly; he
can always help you. You will not want to
disappoint him in any way, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked at her searchingly as one
startled. This was evidently a new thought;
it took hold of her heart. A softened light
came into her unusually expressive eyes and
after a moment she said very gently:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
&quot;No one ever said anything to me like that,
before. It helps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They made great strides toward intimacy
even in that first morning. So great that when
Ruth, pitying the girl&#39;s loneliness and evident
dread of the people by whom she was surrounded,
proposed that she send for her to come and take
dinner with Mrs. Roberts and herself, she caught
at the suggestion with an eagerness which
showed what a relief it was to her; and then
almost immediately demurred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I ought not to presume in that way.
I am certain the Madame will think so. Will not
your friend think it very strange in me, a
stranger, to intrude upon her home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait until you see her,&quot; Ruth said, smiling.
&quot;Mrs. Roberts and I are very old friends, and I
am almost as much at home in her house as I
am in my own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, she felt a sudden stricture at
her heart over those commonplace words. Was
she not in these later days almost more at
home in Flossy&#39;s house than in her own?</p>

<p class="indent">But Maybelle&#39;s face had gloomed over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I must not go, Mrs. Burnham,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
she said. &quot;I suppose I ought not to wish, or
even be willing to go; I am sure Madame Sternheim
will be shocked at the idea. I am in deep
mourning, you know, and my loss is so recent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unconsciously the child had imitated the prim
decorum of her Mentor, and it had changed her
entire face.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth leaned forward impulsively and kissed
her, while she spoke with a smile:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear child, be yourself, and not Madame
Sternheim. Adopt me, will you, and let me
attend to the decorum part, and all the rest.
Mrs. Roberts is quite alone, save for me; her
husband is away on a business trip, and her
children have scattered for the vacation; so
we shall be very quiet, we three; and there is
no reason in the world why you should not come
to us. I want you to know Mrs. Roberts; she
is anxious to see you, and would have come with
me this morning, if she had not thought it better
that you and I should make each other&#39;s acquaintance
first. As for you, you will love her
the first time you look at her. Shall I speak to
Madame Sternheim myself about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When this was done, Madame Sternheim was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
discovered to be graciousness itself. She might
be doubtful as to Mrs. Burnham&#39;s place in the
world, her knowledge of people being limited
and very local, but the name of Mrs. Evan
Roberts called for instant approval, and to know
that Mrs. Burnham was her friend and guest
was sufficient passport for her. It was very kind
and thoughtful in dear Mrs. Roberts, she was
sure, to send for the poor child; and very like
her too, if all that the Madame had heard concerning
her was true. Did Mrs. Burnham know
that her friend had the name of always doing the
most delicate kindnesses that no one else would
have thought of? She was really a wonderful
woman? Madame Sternheim had long wanted
to know her. They need not trouble to send the
dear child home, she herself was going out this
evening, and would have pleasure in calling for
Miss Somerville at ten o&#39;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t it beautiful here?&quot; Maybelle said, a few
hours later, as she sank among the cushions of
a &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and feasted her beauty-loving
eyes on the harmonies of Mrs. Roberts&#39;s
living-room. &quot;It is like a poem, or no, a picture;
that is what it is like, Mrs. Burnham; one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
of papa&#39;s pictures. How he would have loved
this room! He was always making sketches
of sweet, dear, home rooms, and there was
always a beautiful mother in them with a baby
in her arms. I think my mother must have been
very beautiful, for it was always the same face,
and I know it was intended for mamma, though
he never told me so; I could not talk with papa
about her, ever, it made him cry. Don&#39;t you
think it is dreadful to see a man cry? When I
started the tears in his dear blue eyes, I always
felt like a wretch! and for that reason I gave
up trying to say anything about mamma,
though I should so love to have heard every little
thing about her. Papa must simply have adored
her, but I have had to dream her out for myself.
I have spent hours and hours over it, studying
papa&#39;s sketches, you know, and trying to clothe
them with flesh. I believe I know just how she
looked. Sometimes she would grow so real to
me that I almost expected her to hold out her
arms and clasp me to them. I was a wee baby,
you know, when mamma went away.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXII" id="chXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p class="h3">A LOYAL HEART</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> friendship so strangely started between
Mrs. Burnham and the girl thrust upon
her conscience, grew apace. As Ruth had
surmised, her old friend Flossy had lost none
of her charm with young people, and she won
Maybelle&#39;s fascinated interest from the first
moment of their meeting; an interest that
developed rapidly into love.</p>

<p class="indent">When Mrs. Roberts&#39;s young people came home&mdash;an
event that Ruth, at least, had dreaded
for Maybelle&#39;s sake&mdash;it was found that the
charm was increased. Ruth, in writing to
Erskine about them, which she did at some
length, had added: &quot;I might have saved you
much of this description, by simply saying that
the children are very like their mother. Even
Erskine, tall and muscular as he is, a thorough
boy in every sense of the word, and a manly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
one, yet has that indefinable indescribable
charm about him that our little Flossy always
had and always will have, should she live to be
a hundred, bless her! what a blessing she would
be to this old world if she should. Do you
realize, dear, that he is your namesake, as well
as mine? At first I was not sure that I wanted
another Erskine,&mdash;there is but one to me, you
know,&mdash;but Erskine Roberts is such a splendid
repetition of the family name that we cannot
but be proud of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But she gave no description of Maybelle,
and mentioned her name as little as possible.
She shrank almost painfully from the thought of
writing about this girl to one who ought to be
deeply interested in her,&mdash;as in the nature of
the case Erskine should be if he knew,&mdash;and
yet looked upon her as an intruder, almost
resenting his mother&#39;s efforts in her behalf.</p>

<p class="indent">But if she kept silence about her to Erskine,
she atoned for it in the amount of time and
thought that she bestowed upon the child.
As the weeks passed and she grew to better
understand this child-woman with whom she
had to deal, she found herself bestowing upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
her a wealth of love and tenderness that she
had not supposed any but her very own could
call out. And her love was returned in royal
measure. However much Maybelle might admire
and love Mrs. Roberts and enjoy her son
and daughters, she had given the wealth of her
heart unreservedly to Mrs. Burnham. &quot;Next
to Aunt Mamie I love you best of all the world,&quot;
she would declare as she patted Ruth&#39;s shoulder
with a loving little touch that was peculiarly
her own. &quot;It ought always to be Aunt Mamie
first, you know, because she&mdash;she <i>mothered</i> me
all those years when I was hungry for a mother.
Dear Mrs. Burnham, if she were your daughter
and I could be your granddaughter, would not
that be perfect? But that couldn&#39;t be, of
course, for Aunt Mamie loved her own dear
mother better than any other mother in the
world; and she was a <i>dear</i>; I loved her very
much, but&mdash;how many different kinds of love
there can be in the same heart!&quot; she broke off
to say, with the air of a dreamy philosopher,
&quot;Different kinds of loves and different kinds of
unloves, ever so many of them! the heart is a
curious country, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
By that time Mrs. Burnham had come to
understand Miss Parker&#39;s absorbed interest in
the girl, which continued unabated even amid
the absorbing interests of a strange land. She
wrote long loving letters to the child of her
adoption, and long earnest ones to Mrs. Burnham
about her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There have been times,&quot; she wrote, &quot;when
I have almost regretted that I left the dear girl
all alone and came away out here where weeks
must intervene before I can hear from her.
I felt this especially after I found that my
brother, although very glad indeed to welcome
me, had made interests here about which I knew
nothing, one that is to help make a home for him
in the near future, so that so far as care and
companionship are concerned he could have
done very well without me. When I first
began to understand the situation here, I was
puzzled, and just a little bit troubled over the
question why I had been allowed to come, or
rather left to think that to come was the only
right course, when apparently I was much
more needed at home on that dear child&#39;s
account, than here. But after reading Maybelle&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
letter I understood that it was in order
to leave the way clear and plain for her to your
dear heart; you can do so much more for her
than I can ever hope to. How blissful the
darling is over her new friendships and interests!
I am glad that you have kidnapped her loyal
little heart, just as I knew you would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor girl!&quot; Mrs. Burnham said softly to
herself after reading this letter. &quot;She has one
of those hungry hearts that Maybelle talks
about; and she fancied that her brother could
fill it, instead of being quite satisfied with his
generous corner of it! I wonder if it can be
possible that she cared for the child&#39;s father, as
the Madame hints? That would account for&mdash;but
there is nothing to be accounted for; one
could not help loving Maybelle. I must tell
Miss Parker that she is always to have the first
place in that &#39;curious&#39; heart, while I am
enthroned as second. Dear simpleton!&quot; Then,
as the thought crossed her mind, not for the
first time, that the one who should hold that
first place might be named Erskine, the uneasy
conviction shook her that in such event certain
ugly truths would have to be revealed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
But she put the thought from her as soon as
possible. She could not plan for the future,
and for the present, Maybelle and Erskine
Roberts were simply comrades heartily enjoying
each other&#39;s society, as her own Erskine and
Alice Warder had done, without apparently
other thoughts than those shared with them by
Marian Roberts, who was Erskine&#39;s twin.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth wrote to Miss Parker that same evening,
giving her a detailed account of one of her
talks with Maybelle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may well call hers a &#39;loyal heart,&#39;
my friend,&quot; she wrote. &quot;You should hear the
pathetic way in which the child talks about
you by the hour! Yesterday she said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Sometimes I used to wish that I could call
Aunt Mamie, mother. She is the only woman
that I ever had such a thought about; I suppose
it was because she came close enough to
give me an idea of what a real mother would be.
I mean to keep her always for my heart-mother.
There can be heart-mothers, you know, and in
some ways they are almost as dear as real ones.
Oh, I wonder if you know how a girl like me
sometimes longs and <i>longs</i> for a real mother!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
I think it is the only possession that I ever
envied. Sometimes, Mrs. Burnham, I have
been fiercely jealous for hours together, so that
I almost hated the girls who chattered about
their mothers. Wasn&#39;t that dreadful! Oh, I
cannot think what would have become of me
long before this, if I had not had Aunt Mamie.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus much Ruth Burnham wrote, and
stayed her pen. Was it necessary for her to
tell all this? To lay bare even to this woman,
who knew so much, the depths of a suffering
young heart, thereby revealing the magnitude
of the mother&#39;s sin against it? And that mother
was her daughter, her son&#39;s wife! She wanted
to write it; there were times when she wanted
to shout it out to all the world, just what
manner of woman was being sheltered by her
name and home. She knew that she would never
do it, but ought not Mamie Parker who had
mothered the child, to understand? She thought
long, she shed a few struggling tears that seemed
to burn her face; the hurt at her heart was too
deep for tears, and then she hid her face on the
writing table and talked with God.</p>

<p class="indent">The end of it was that she tore the sheet across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
and threw the fragments into her grate. And
wrote again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may well call hers a &#39;loyal heart,&#39; my
friend; she loves with a depth that seems to me
unusual in one so young; and she has enthroned
you at her heart&#39;s very centre. I want
to say, just here, that I do not think she overestimates
what you have done for her; I believe
you have saved her to herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, the days that Mrs. Burnham,
without any definite planning, had thought
might be given to her visit lengthened into
weeks, and still she lingered in the East.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine was astonished, was bewildered,
was half indignant, yet she set no date for the
home-going. One reason for this was the fact
that Mr. Roberts&#39;s stay abroad, which was to
have been very brief, had been much lengthened
by unexpected business complications, and his
wife was begging her old friend to stay with
her until his return. But of course there was
no real excuse for this, as she had her children
and multitudes of home friends about her.
The real reason was that Ruth could not decide
to leave Maybelle. The girl clung to her with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
an ever increasing abandon to the joy of having
for her very own one who knew how to be in
every sense of the word motherly. Certainly
she was nearer real happiness than her confused
life had ever been before. From being one
whom some of her schoolmates pitied and
patronized because she seemed to have no friends
of her own except a somewhat doubtful father,
she became almost an object of envy.</p>

<p class="indent">All of the girls at Madame Sternheim&#39;s knew
Mrs. Evan Roberts by reputation; and highly
exaggerated stories of her house and her friends
and her lavish expenditures for certain of them,
were afloat in the school. But it chanced that
Maybelle was the first one of the school girls
who had entered the charmed circle of Mrs.
Roberts&#39;s friendships.</p>

<p class="indent">When it became known that she was being
sent for three or four times a week to take
dinner with the Roberts family, that she went
on Tuesdays to luncheon, that she spent most
of her Saturdays and Sundays in the same
choice home, interest in her comings and goings
became marked. Then, when she began slowly,
and almost reluctantly it must be admitted, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
choose out some especially lonely or homesick
or timid girl to take with her to dine at Mrs.
Roberts&#39;s, her popularity knew no bounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Sternheim, too, during these days
was gracious almost beyond recognition. It
was not that the good woman had not meant to
be gracious always; she had been faithful to
her duty as she saw it, and poor Maybelle, who
confessed that she had hours of almost hating
her, had in reality very much for which to
thank her.</p>

<p class="indent">But Madame Sternheim was very human
indeed, and the daughter of a poor artist father
with a questionable past and a doubtful future,
whose only friend, apparently, was a very fine
young woman, it is true, but a woman without
family and with no reasonable way of accounting
for her interest in the girl, and nothing to
show how soon the interest might cease&mdash;for
that matter she had already gone away off to
China for no reason in particular, unless it
was to be well rid of her charge now that the
father was gone&mdash;was one person, and a girl
who had apparently been adopted into the inner
circle of Mrs. Roberts&#39;s family was quite another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
especially now that the poor father had been
respectably buried and all doubtful or uncomfortable
things could be forgotten. Madame
Sternheim was relieved and pleased and hopeful.
She liked to have Mrs. Roberts&#39;s carriage stand
before her door waiting for Maybelle. She
liked to say to certain of her patrons:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the coachman is used to waiting; our
dear Maybelle is almost certain to be tardy,
but then she is so much at home at Mrs. Roberts&#39;s
house that she can take all sorts of liberties.
Oh, yes, she dines there several times a week
and often takes some of her classmates with
her. Dear Mrs. Roberts welcomes my girls
to her home as though she were their elder
sister. What a charming woman she is! Really
when one comes to know her intimately, one
feels that the half has not been told concerning
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Maybelle was blossoming under this
reign of love. Her cheeks were rounding out
a little and taking on a touch of color, and her
eyes were growing less sad. She had by no
means forgotten her grief nor put aside the
thought of her father. On the contrary, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
liked nothing better than to talk of him by the
hour to a sympathetic listener, while to be
allowed to talk about her mother, was to give
free vent to the one pent-up passion of her life.</p>

<p class="indent">It was to Mrs. Burnham that she talked most
freely, though Mrs. Roberts&#39;s young people were
sympathetic, and Erskine, especially, liked
nothing better than to hear long stories about
the artist and his method of dealing with a
picture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He made them up,&quot; Maybelle would say,
&quot;composed them, you know, or made a plot,
as you do when you write a story for your college
paper. The picture grew, just as a story does.
&#39;That&#39;s an idea!&#39; papa would say, when I was
sitting meekly enough beside him, telling him
some story of my day. &#39;That&#39;s a look I never
saw before, let me get it, Maysie&#39;&mdash;that was
one of his dear names for me, he had dozens
of them&mdash;and he would seize palette and brush
and work for a few minutes as hard as he could,
then sit back and gaze at me and think, and I
knew that a new picture was born and would
have to be watched over and nourished and
developed. It was very interesting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
&quot;Yes, indeed! he painted me a hundred times
and in a hundred different ways, but they did
him no good; he never would try to sell them,
nor even show them. They are all boxed up
with our other things and stored; Aunt Mamie
took charge of them. He told her they were
never to be sold. I think it was because my
mother&#39;s picture was always mixed in with
them, and he could not bear to sell her. He
used to make pictures of me, sometimes, that
he said were like mamma. There would be
just little hints of me about them, not a likeness
of me at all, but a beautiful girl, and the tears
would come into papa&#39;s dear eyes when he
looked at her, and he would say softly, &#39;It is
her image.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Maybelle talked in this way to Ruth,
she once or twice said wistfully:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be beautiful to be loved in the way
that my father loved my mother.&quot; But
Erskine Roberts never heard any words of this
kind.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXIII" id="chXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p class="h3">PUZZLING QUESTIONS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;This</span> is lovely!&quot; said Maybelle, as she drew
the curtains, and pushed her sewing chair
closer to Mrs. Burnham&#39;s. &quot;Isn&#39;t it nice to
be alone together? Erskine wanted me to go
with them to the rehearsal and act as prompter,
but I told him I was going to follow the promptings
of my own heart and stay with you, especially
since his mother must also be away. If
we lived all alone in a dear little home, you and
I, I could take care of you all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid I should need something besides
lovely rooms and pretty sewing,&quot; Mrs. Burnham
said laughingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed! but I could do them; all sorts
of things. I used to do things for Mrs. Parker,
and for papa when he would let me. I was
always coaxing papa to have a little bit of a
house just large enough for us two, and let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
take charge of it; I knew I could; I could
learn, you know, and Mrs. Parker taught me
a great many things; but he never would.
Poor papa! he didn&#39;t want a home; he said
that he had one once, and he wanted it to live
in his memory forever. He meant that time&mdash;before
mamma died. Do you think it is like
most men to be so constant to a memory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know,&quot; Mrs. Burnham said, with
an effort. She never knew what to say to
Maybelle when she was in this mood. It was
impossible to join in the talk about a dead
mother, and not feel herself a hypocrite. But
Maybelle was already on another theme.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Mrs. Burnham, I am glad we are alone
to-night. There are matters about which I
want to talk with you.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know, I have been treated always
like a little girl? and it seems to me that the
time has come for me to begin to be a woman.
I used to try to get papa to tell me about his
affairs, but he never would. During those last
dreadful days, all he would tell me was that he
had left everything to Aunt Mamie, and I was
to do just as she said. But I have a feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
that papa was poor; and that he just made
enough by his pictures to support us, perhaps
not always that; I have thought lately that
perhaps a great many of my nice things and&mdash;and
opportunities, came through Aunt Mamie.
Madame Sternheim has dropped hints more
than once that have made me believe so. And
now,&mdash;don&#39;t you think I ought to know all about
it, and be making plans to support myself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear!&quot; was all that Ruth could say,
in an almost dismayed tone. Maybelle&#39;s future
and her connection with it were more puzzling
to Erskine Burnham&#39;s mother than they could
possibly be to this child. The earnest young
voice went on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wrote to Aunt Mamie just how I felt, but
she cannot see it as I do. She says that she is
alone in the world, that money is the only thing
she has enough of, and that papa gave me to
her to take care of. She does not understand
why I should not be quite happy over such an
arrangement; but dear Mrs. Burnham, I am
sure you do. It is not that I do not love to
belong to her, I mean to, always; and sometimes
I cannot sleep for the joy of thinking that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
loves me so dearly; I can&#39;t think why she does.
But don&#39;t you think that a self-respecting girl
wants to support herself just as soon as she
possibly can, unless she has a father and mother
who can do it as well as not, and want to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This also was a sore and embarrassing phase
of the subject to poor Ruth. Oh, to be able to
say to her that her mother, her own mother, was
in a position to cover for her every need that
money could supply and that the man who now
stood in the place of father to her would insist
upon so much tardy justice&mdash;if he knew of her
existence! Yet Ruth&#39;s common sense told her
that even though there were no terrible reasons
for silence for the sake of others, the hardest
blow that could be given to a girl like Maybelle
would be to destroy her beautiful illusions of
her mother with the base truth. That mother
of sacred memory, alive, well, living in ease and
luxury and ignoring her as utterly as though she
had never been born! Could such a cruel
blow as that be borne! Yet any words that
this much-tried woman could arrange in reply to
the appeal just made, seemed false. She hesitated,
and knew that her face was flushing under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
the girl&#39;s earnest gaze. At last, she said the
only words there seemed left for her to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, I am a little bit on both sides of
this question. I certainly sympathize with
your view, and on general principles should agree
with you. But the circumstances are peculiar
this time.&quot; And as she said the words she felt
like a hypocrite; how peculiar they were, that
poor child had not the least idea! &quot;Miss Parker
is, as she says, practically alone in the world.
Her brother&#39;s marriage is a coming event; then
he will not need her any more, in the special
sense in which she can help him now, and he
does not need her money, for he has plenty
of his own. Their father discovered a gold
mine, you know, as well as one of another metal,
almost more valuable than gold. So, if Miss
Parker wants to spend a little of her surplus
money upon you, because she loves you, ought
you not to please her in this, and be governed
by her advice, at least for the present? When
you are older, and especially when Miss Parker
returns home, which I think she will do before
very long, probably some plans can be made that
will please you both. Cannot you wait, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
Maybelle sat thoughtful for a moment, then
she drew a long sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I must,&quot; she said. &quot;Indeed, there
is no other way for me at present; only&mdash;I
am to graduate, you know, in a few days, and
I thought&mdash;but of course I ought not, contrary
to Aunt Mamie&#39;s wishes. But I do not
know what she wants me to do for the summer.
She has not seemed to remember it. I have
always spent the summer vacations with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not to forecast anxieties about the
summer,&quot; Mrs. Burnham said, trying to make
her voice sound cheery and free from all anxiety,
though it struck her like a physical pain,
the fact that she could not say to this girl who
was growing dearer to her with every passing
day, &quot;Come home with me, child, of course;&quot;
that she could never invite her to her home,
and could never explain to her why she must
not. She must simply be silent and trust to
Maybelle&#39;s shrewd guessing that there were
reasons why this new friend of hers did not feel
at home in her own home, and was not at liberty
to take her friends there.</p>

<p class="indent">It was true that summer was upon them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
the air of the boarding school was athrob with
the plans of eager girls getting ready for the
home-going. Maybelle was almost the only one
who had not some sort of home to plan for.
And yet Maybelle was to graduate! If only
Mrs. Burnham could say to her, &quot;Come, we
will make home together, and you may do for
me all that your heart prompts.&quot; There were
hours when she was tempted to do something
of the kind. But her words to Maybelle revealed
none of her pain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are lovely schemes maturing for the
summer. &#39;Good times,&#39; my dear, and unlike
the illustrious Gloriana McQuirk you are &#39;in
&#39;em.&#39; I am not to divulge them before the
appointed hour, but I empower you to say to
those envious schoolgirls that your summer plans
are a delicious secret even from yourself, being
locked in the heart of that blessed little schemer,
Mrs. Roberts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle&#39;s face was still serious, but, after
a moment, she laughed softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am the strangest girl!&quot; she said. &quot;I
don&#39;t think there can be another girl in the
world who lives my kind of life. I have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
what Madame Sternheim calls a &#39;relative&#39; this
side heaven to care what becomes of me, and
I have the dearest company of people, on whom,
according to Madame again, I have not the
shadow of a claim, who never weary of doing
for me! What more, for instance, could you
and that dear Mrs. Roberts and those girls
and boys of hers do for me, even though I had
that potent charm, some of &#39;the same blood&#39;
in my veins? And yet, do you know, selfish
creature that I am, the Madame has so instilled
her principles into me that if I only had a
sister or brother of my very own to love and
care for, I think I could give up joyfully all
other luxuries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you not forgetting your aunts in England,
my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle shook her head and spoke resolutely.
&quot;I want to forget them; I do not claim them as
aunts of mine.&quot; Then, in response to Ruth&#39;s
look that might have meant reproach, she
added:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They did not like mamma, Mrs. Burnham,
and they were not good to her. Papa told me
as much as that. He said she was young,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
and away from all her home friends and unhappy,
and they led her a hard life. Papa could not
help feeling hard toward them for that. It
was the reason why he never went to England
again after Grandmother died. He took me
to see Grandmother, did you know that? But
she did not seem like a grandmother. She
wasn&#39;t <i>dear</i>, you know, and sweet, like the
grandmothers in stories, and in real life too,&mdash;some
of the girls at school have lovely ones,&mdash;but
mine was stately and cold. She and my
two aunts used to talk about mamma right
before me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;She looks like <i>her</i>,&#39; one of them said, with a
strong emphasis on the &#39;her&#39; a contemptuous
emphasis it seemed to me. And the other aunt
replied, &#39;But she isn&#39;t like her in disposition,
apparently.&#39; Then Grandmother said quickly,
&#39;Heaven forbid!&#39; Could one love people who
talked in that way before a child about her dear
dead mother? Not that they meant me to
understand,&quot; she added thoughtfully, after a
moment, as one who must do full justice even
to one&#39;s enemies. &quot;I don&#39;t think they did;
they were the kind of people who think that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
child is deaf and blind and stupid. I understood
hints and shrugs of the shoulders and curls of
the lip and exclamations a great deal better
than they thought I did. I have no relatives,
dear Mrs. Burnham, that I care for, but I have
friends whom I love with every bit of me. May
I ask just one little question?&mdash;and you need not
answer it if it is part of the secret. Do the
summer plans include you? Because if they
don&#39;t, and there could be a way for me to have
you for just a little piece of the summer, I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tremble in her voice had grown so marked
that she stopped abruptly. She looked up,
after a minute, with her eyes swimming in tears,
and said with a queer little attempt at a laugh:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going to cry, Mrs. Burnham, don&#39;t
you be afraid. And I&#39;m not going to be selfish
and babyish; I mean to be just as glad and
happy and grateful as I can be, even though you
have to be away from me all summer long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was just at that moment that Ruth resolved
upon yielding to Flossy&#39;s entreaties and spending
at least part of the summer with them at
their new seaside cottage, which was to be a
surprise to all the young people, Maybelle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
included. Erskine expected her at home, but
what were Erskine&#39;s needs compared to this
deserted child&#39;s?&mdash;and the child clung to her.
But she would not tell Maybelle, not just yet;
so she spoke lightly, commending the child&#39;s
resolve to count her mercies, and then admonishing
her that she had better also count
her stitches, as she was making a mistake in
the row she was crocheting.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a thoughtful silence on the part of
both for a few minutes, then Maybelle spoke
again in what Mrs. Burnham called her grown-up
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one strange question I have wanted
to ask of somebody for a long time. I tried
to talk to Erskine about it without letting him
know that it was really a question in my mind;
but Erskine is like all boys, very wise and very
positive, without being always able to give a
reason for what he believes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which means,&quot; said Ruth, smiling, &quot;that
Erskine did not agree with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he didn&#39;t,&quot; and Maybelle stopped to
laugh at herself; then spoke earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is, so far as I may be said to have an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
opinion on that subject; I am not sure what I
think, or at least I do not know why I think it.
Mrs. Burnham, do Christian people ever pray
for their dead? And if they do not, why not?
Does the Bible say we must not? I have tried
to find something in the Bible about it, and I
could not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth was much startled. This was very
different from the question she had expected.
The young people argued vigorously upon
every live question of the day, not excepting
interesting theological points, but this was out
of the regular line. While she considered just
how best to answer it, Maybelle explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose that seems to you a strange question;
young people do not often discuss such
things, I suppose; but it interests me very
much because I have such a longing, sometimes,
to pray for mamma, that I can hardly keep her
name from my lips; yet I thought perhaps it
was wrong. I began to have that feeling almost
as soon as Aunt Mamie taught me to pray. I
had said my prayers before that time; papa
taught me to say: &#39;Now I lay me down to sleep,&#39;
and &#39;Bless thy little lamb to-night.&#39; I used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
like to say them, but I did not understand what
praying really was, until long after that time.
But when Aunt Mamie made it plain to me, and
my heart took hold of the fact that I was really
talking with God, and that I could talk to Him
about papa, and in that way help him, I cannot
tell you how glad I was! And then, very soon,
I wanted to put mamma in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing that the girl had said had ever startled
Ruth as much as this. Was there a woman
living who needed prayer more than this child&#39;s
mother? Yet how could she counsel her
daughter to pray for her?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXXIV" id="chXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p class="h3">AN ALLY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;I</span> do not know that there is any &#39;thus
saith the Lord,&#39; against your wish, my
dear,&quot; she said at last, in a hesitating tone,
&quot;but the inference from all gospel teaching
seems to be that this life is the time for prayer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle gave a disappointed sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think people would study into it,&quot;
she said, &quot;and find out if they might. It
makes such an awful blank in one&#39;s praying
to suddenly leave out a name that has been
on one&#39;s lips and in one&#39;s heart for years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Ruth knew that the child was thinking
of her father, and that she must move very
carefully in trying to comfort her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not have that feeling about my father,
Maybelle dear, nor about my husband. On
the contrary I had an almost joyful realization
that they were beyond the need for prayer&mdash;were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
where they could make no mistakes, where
the mistakes of others could never harm them
any more, and where they would be forever in
the presence of the Lord. What could one possibly
ask more for them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle was silent for several minutes, and
her eyes were soft with unshed tears. Then
she spoke gently:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a lovely thought! thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment she began again, earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham, there is something I want
you to know. What I am sure that Madame
Sternheim thinks about my papa isn&#39;t true.
Papa learned how to pray; and every afternoon
during those last few weeks, he and I
used to read in the Bible together, and pray.
And the last time I saw him he told me that,
although he had wasted his life, and been in
every way a different man from what he ought
to have been, God had forgiven him, and was
going to take him home. He wasn&#39;t a bad
man, ever, Mrs. Burnham; at least&mdash;well, I
know he did some wrong things, but he was
good in many ways. He had a very low estimate
of himself, though, and those were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
words he said. I shall never forget the last
sentence he ever spoke; I can often close my
eyes and seem to hear his dear voice with its
note of exultation, &#39;It is wonderful, but I am
going <i>home</i>!&#39; He used to speak that word
&#39;home&#39; in a peculiar manner; his voice seemed
to linger over it lovingly, like a caress. He had
no home, you know, after mamma went away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was Maybelle&#39;s way of speaking of death;
but the woman, who realized how literally the
phrase &quot;went away&quot; applied to this child&#39;s
mother, could never hear it without an inward
shudder. Her own eyes had dimmed with tears
as she listened to this pathetic and yet gracious
close of a wasted life. Then she acted upon a
sudden resolution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybelle, dear, there is one person for whom
I want you to pray with all your soul; that is
my son&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your daughter?&quot; said Maybelle, lingering
over the word as a sweet sound, yet with a hint
of surprise in her tone, as though she might
almost ask, &quot;Why should any woman so blessed
as she need praying for?&quot; But what she
added was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
&quot;I should love to pray for her. Tell me about
her, please. She must be a very happy woman
to have the right to call you &#39;mother.&#39; What
is it you want me to ask for her? Of course
she is a Christian?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a member of the church,&quot; said Ruth.
&quot;But I do not think she knows the Lord Jesus
in the way that you and I know Him, or that
she loves and serves Him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Maybelle, and that single mono-syllable
from her lips meant much. Surprise,
regret, pity, resolve, were all expressed in it.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth made haste to finish what she had resolved to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And she needs to know Him; oh! she
needs it more than most women do. If she
could come, even now, into intimate fellowship
with the Lord Jesus Christ, it would make an
infinite difference, not only with her life, but
in the lives of others. There are others who&mdash;&quot;
She stopped abruptly; excitement was getting
the better of discretion. She must have a
care what she said. After a moment she spoke
with less intensity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you will pray, too, for Erskine. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
my son, I mean.&quot; For Maybelle had made a
little startled movement at the mention of this
name, and turned great wondering eyes upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son&#39;s name is Erskine, you remember.
He is my only one, dear, the only treasure that
I ever had; for years and years he has been
all that I have; and I cry out so for God&#39;s best
for him! He is a Christian, a good, true Christian
man; he is everything that to other people
seems desirable; but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I know what you mean,&quot; Maybelle
said gently. &quot;I know that there can be
degrees in living religion. Sometimes I think I
know that fact better than any other; I have
had so many illustrations of it in my life. It
must be hard for him that his wife does not
always think just as he does in this. At least
I should think it would be very hard indeed for
married people not to be as one in such matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ruth, &quot;it is very hard.&quot; Then
she turned suddenly to a radically different
subject, with the conviction strong upon her
that she could talk no more about Erskine and
Irene without saying what would be better left
unsaid.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
But she had secured a wonderful ally in Maybelle.
The girl knew how to pray, and her
faith was as the faith of a little child: simple,
and literal, and firm. She became intensely
interested in Mrs. Burnham&#39;s daughter-in-law.
She asked many questions about her, sometimes
making remarks, in her ignorance, that
wrung Ruth&#39;s heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I love her,&quot; she said one day. &quot;There
are times when I feel a curious yearning tenderness
for her, as though I must put my arms about
her and kiss her. It seems strange, doesn&#39;t it,
when I have never seen her? I do not love a
great many people; of course I like ever so
many, but this feeling that I have is different.
Still, I suppose it is the way one feels toward
those for whom one prays, definitely and daily.
Isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Ruth, unable to add another
word, and turning away her face so that the
child could not see what it might express.
If only Irene had loved <i>her</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">One noticeable feature of this time was that
Maybelle began to speak confidently regarding
the answer to her prayers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
&quot;You will tell me when your daughter truly
begins to serve Jesus Christ, won&#39;t you?&quot; she
said. &quot;I think I should like to know it, soon,
because it changes the tone of one&#39;s prayers,
don&#39;t you think, as soon as one for whom you
have been asking just this, recognizes Jesus
Christ and begins to be acquainted with Him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You speak very confidently, dear,&quot; Ruth
could not help saying. &quot;Do you always feel
quite sure that the people for whom you pray
will &#39;recognize&#39; Jesus Christ?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always,&quot; the girl said thoughtfully.
&quot;I cannot be sure, because they may keep on
refusing to let Him in, and of course He will not
force an entrance. When I was a little girl, I
thought that was very strange. I wondered
why God did not <i>make</i> people love and serve
Him, whether they wanted to, or not. But
when I grew old enough to realize what love
really is, I knew better; for what is enforced
service worth? and as for enforced <i>love</i>, that
couldn&#39;t be. But sometimes the feeling comes
to me that the one for whom I am asking, will
let him in; and I have it now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then Mrs. Burnham began to desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
exceedingly that this girl should pray mightily
for her son. More than all things else, more
even than that the rags of his outward respectability&mdash;as
regarded his home&mdash;might be
preserved to him, did she long for his entire
consecration to God. She knew only too well
that, despite his strict integrity and his firm
adherence to the letter of his faith, the world
was gripping him with a mighty hold. She
knew, too, how insidiously and how surely
Irene&#39;s views, and Irene&#39;s feelings, and Irene&#39;s
wishes were slipping in between him and that
entirely consecrated life which would hold him
safe above all the world&#39;s allurements.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not that he was markedly different in
word or deed from what his early manhood had
promised. It was rather that he had not grown,
spiritually, with the passing years; and of late
years, since his marriage, his mother could
detect a backward movement, as of one drifting
downstream imperceptibly to himself, and
losing force. There were times when she felt
almost jealous of the hold which her daughter-in-law
had taken upon the heart of this girl
who believed as well as prayed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
&quot;You will not forget my Erskine?&quot; she said
one day when they had been talking about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Maybelle said quickly. &quot;No,
indeed! How could I, dear Mrs. Burnham,
when he is your son, and you asked me to pray
for him? I never forget him; but after all,
it isn&#39;t so important, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot; The mother was almost indignant.
From her standpoint nothing in life
seemed quite so important as that Erskine should
be the kind of Christian that the Lord wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, because,&quot; said the child, wonderingly,
&quot;he <i>belongs</i>, you know, and&mdash;won&#39;t the dear
Lord take care of his own? But it is different
with her,&mdash;why, she may not let Him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was the most peculiar emphasis of
that word &quot;belongs&quot;; and almost infinite dismay
expressed by the last phrase. Maybelle
was a literalist. She believed that when the
Lord said, &quot;Ye <i>will not</i> come unto me that ye
might have life,&quot; he meant that it was quite
within man&#39;s power to refuse it.</p>

<p class="indent">But from that hour Ruth&#39;s heart was quieter
concerning her son, and she prayed in stronger
faith. Erskine &quot;belonged&quot; and she could trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
the Lord to take care of His own. It seemed
strange, but the child was really helping the
Christian of mature years. &quot;Except ye become
as little children,&quot; she repeated to her
heart with a grateful smile. Maybelle&#39;s faith
was as the faith of a little child; that was
what made it so strong.</p>

<p class="indent">The plans for the summer matured and, to
the joy of all concerned, Mrs. Burnham was carried
a willing captive to the new seaside home;
and, on one pretext or another, lingered there
from week to week. The young people were
fertile in schemes, and vied with one another
in pretexts to hold her just a few days more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot surely go until after the fourteenth!&quot;
and &quot;Why, we must have you for the
twenty-first, anyway!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime, Erskine was growing almost indignant,
at least on paper. His final argument
was put with lawyer-like directness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to be true that you have ceased to
care for your son, but perhaps the advent of
your grandson will move you. Erskine Burnham,
Junior, arrived at four this morning, as I
have already announced to you by telegram,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
and is in excellent health and spirits, and very
desirous of beholding the face of his grandmother;
I might remark, in passing, that his
father and mother sympathize with him in this
desire, save that the cruel grandmother seems
to be quite dead to all natural affection. We
are hoping that to have a grandson will be something
so unnatural as to arouse her desires for
home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But if he could have seen his mother during
that first hour after the despatch reached her,
he would have been deeply pained as well as
puzzled. Did ever grandmother take such
triumphant news in such strange fashion before?
She was alone in her room, and she let
the paper drop away from her while she hid her
face in her hands and shook as though in an
ague chill. Her grandson! yes, but Irene&#39;s
son! born of such a mother into this dangerous,
sin-stricken world! to be trained by such
a mother! and her fair and lovely daughter an
outlaw at this moment from her mother&#39;s home
and heart! How would it be possible for a boy
with such an inheritance as such a mother
would give him, to escape the snares that would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
assuredly be set for him? Great waves of
pain seemed to have this woman in its clutches,
as she lived over again her own young motherhood,
and thought of all that it had meant to
her, and contrasted herself with that other
mother; and remembered that she was the
mother of Erskine Burnham&#39;s son.</p>

<p class="indent">But by degrees saner thoughts began to come.
Heredity was not everything, she reminded herself;
and even according to it its full place, had
not the boy a father? The thought of Maybelle
in this connection helped to quiet her. Was
ever sweeter, purer, more lovable girl born of
woman than she? And was not that same
woman her mother? What of heredity here?</p>

<p class="indent">But the girl was deserted by her mother, and
mercifully preserved from such training as she
would have given. What was that promise?
&quot;When my father and mother forsake me, then
the Lord will take me up.&quot; Had not the Lord
made good this word? If only this little new
boy, her grandson, could&mdash;And then Ruth
turned in stern repellence from herself. What
was this that she was thinking! Could not
God take care of his own?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
But she must go home, of course she must go
home now, at once. But she did not. One
of Mrs. Roberts&#39;s flock fell ill, and before noon of
the following day was very seriously, even desperately
ill, and there followed a long, hard
battle with disease; and Ruth, who had lingered
for her pleasure, apparently, could not of
course leave them now, when for the first time
there was opportunity to be of real service.
The sick one, even after the battle was fought,
was slow in convalescing, and the mother was
worn, and Ruth could see that she held a place
in this home that no one else just then could
fill, and she stayed.</p>

<p class="indent">So it came to pass that the summer was gone,
and the Roberts household was established in
town again, and Maybelle was entered at Madame
Sternheim&#39;s for a year of graduate work,
before the Burnham carriage waited at the
station for the belated grandmother, and her
son paced the station platform more eager and
impatient for his mother than it seemed to him
he had ever been in his life before, and his
son was two months old that day.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXV" id="chXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p class="h3">A CRISIS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;Do</span> you think I will ever let you go away
from us again?&quot; This was Erskine
Burnham&#39;s word to his mother when he had her
all to himself in the carriage. His arms were
about her, and he was kissing eyes and nose and
hair after the fashion of his childhood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such a wicked, wicked grandmother! Does
she think she deserves the most beautiful, most
intelligent grandson that ever drew breath?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout that drive they were very gay;
both of them covered under the semblance of
merrymaking, the deep feeling that neither
wished just then to express.</p>

<p class="indent">Only once, as the carriage turned in at the
familiar gateway, did Erskine trust himself
to a tender word:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O mommie, mommie! do you suppose
you know anything about how a boy feels to
get his mother again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
&quot;My boy!&quot; she began, but her voice broke,
and she could not utter another word. And
then the carriage drew up before the side entrance,
and Erskine became very busy with the
bags and wraps, and believed that his mother&#39;s
emotion was the natural feeling of a grandmother
on coming into her possession.</p>

<p class="indent">The weeks that immediately followed were
very far from happy ones, although one member
of the family circle was doing her utmost
in the interests of peace.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Burnham had not lingered for months
away from her home simply from dread of
facing the situation; nor yet on account entirely
of the young girl whom she had taken to her
heart; there had been underneath these, a determined
purpose to leave those two quite to
themselves; to try the effect upon Irene of
relieving her for a time of her mother-in-law&#39;s
daily presence. It is true she had not planned
just how long she could do this&mdash;she had not
been sure when she went away that it could be
done, save for a few days; but she had allowed
herself to be apparently swayed by every passing
reason for delay, despite Erskine&#39;s evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
bewilderment over such action, with an end in
view which had to do with that solemn self-sacrifice
she had made. It remained to be seen
whether this phase of it had been of any avail.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, Irene was gracious, or tried to be; but
in all her apparent sweetness, and sometimes
even attempts at deference, there was a curious
little undertone sting, which made Ruth feel
constrained, and always uncertain what to say
or do next.</p>

<p class="indent">But the baby, toward whom her sore heart
turned with a hunger that was almost pain, was
as fair and sweet a creation as ever came from
the thought of God. So like his father&mdash;in the
eyes of the grandmother, that there were moments
when she could shut herself up alone
with him and live her mother-joy over again.</p>

<p class="indent">Not many of them; her time with him was
literally counted by moments, and grew more
and more uncertain each passing day.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth had schooled herself to see at least indifference
on the part of the mother toward her
child, and had planned how she would try to
atone for such unutterable loss by making him
the very centre of her own life. But behold!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
instead of anything like indifference, Irene
developed a love for the child so passionate, so
fierce, indeed, that it suggested the instinct of
wild animals, instead of cultivated motherhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, the poor mother was jealous of
even the nurse who lavished loving nonsense
upon her baby, and intensely jealous of the
grandmother, for whom the baby, even thus
early in his life, began to exhibit a perverse
fondness.</p>

<p class="indent">The entire situation was a surprise, and, it
must be admitted, an added blow to Ruth.
Instead of being able to rejoice that the maternal
instinct had been at last awakened in this
woman, she was dismayed and heartsick over
it. If Irene meant to begin thus early to keep
the boy under her constant care and surveillance,
what hope was there for his future?</p>

<p class="indent">She awakened to the fact that she had been
counting upon this mother&#39;s fondness for all
sorts of social functions, and expecting to see
her enter with zest upon her former care-free
life, thus making it possible for the baby to be
much under his grandmother&#39;s supervision.
She had planned prematurely. Irene seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
to have forgotten society; she never walked,
or drove, without her baby; she kept him with
her during all his waking moments, and apparently
lived for the purpose of warding off the
attentions of, especially, his grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">In vain did Ruth try, by utmost deference to
the mother&#39;s superior claim, by never presuming
to offer even a suggestion as to the child&#39;s care,
to disarm the intense dislike that Irene could
not help showing&mdash;a dislike of having her even
notice the child.</p>

<p class="indent">So marked was this condition of things becoming
to the servants that Ruth, beyond
measure distressed and bewildered, stayed much
of the time in her own room, and considered and
abandoned a dozen schemes for going away
again. The difficulty was to make any movement
that would not excite Erskine&#39;s suspicion;
for Erskine, being a man and a very busy one,
continued to be what Irene once told him he
was, &quot;as blind as a bat.&quot; He was a very proud,
glad father, prepared to believe that his son was
the sweetest, brightest, most beautiful baby
who ever blessed the earth with his presence,
and he was unequivocally and blissfully happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
at seeing that baby in his grandmother&#39;s arms.
In rejoicing over her home-coming, and in delighting
over the thought of having his son
grow up in daily intimacy with her, he said
&quot;we&quot; as heartily and jubilantly as though
certain that Irene shared his happiness, and it
is certain that he so believed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have learned one lesson, anyway,&quot; he
said gayly, as they sat together one evening
after dinner. &quot;That is that we mustn&#39;t let
you get away from home again very soon.
A mother who has no conception of when it
is time to come home must not be allowed
her freedom. Do you think we have forgiven
you already for those months of indifference
to us? What was the charm, mommie? You
have never told us. The truth is, you have
told us very little about that long visit. Irene
used to be sure that there was some attraction
that you did not reveal. Have you made
her confess, Irene?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene made a feint of joining in his gayety,
and said something about not thinking it worth
while to attempt what he had failed in accomplishing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; Erskine said, after a moment, puzzled
and a trifle hurt because his mother did not
seem to join heartily in the nonsense, &quot;there
is one comfort; I am not afraid of her deserting
us again. Erskine Burnham, Junior, is an attraction
that will hold, even though his father&#39;s
power seems to have waned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was by random sentences like these, that
Ruth was made to realize how difficult it would
be to get away again.</p>

<p class="indent">As the days passed and the situation grew
more and more strained, the mother&#39;s only
comfort was that Erskine did not understand it.
How should he? The claims of business pressed
every day more heavily upon him. From being
the younger partner in a great legal firm, as his
decided ability became known, he had risen
steadily, until responsibilities as well as honors
had been thrust upon him, and he was now a
recognized power in his profession. This meant
very close attention to business, and he had
scarcely any time that he could call his own.</p>

<p class="indent">How could he know, and, after a little, the
resolute mother asked herself why he should
ever know that when he left his beautiful home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
each morning for his long, busy day in town,
he left jealousy and suspicion and unreasoning
aversion behind him?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think she hates me,&quot; Ruth said to herself
as she sat in her room with folded hands and
listened to the vigorous protests of the boy
across the hall, and knew that she, his grandmother,
who loved every hair of his dear golden
head, must hold herself from going to him. &quot;I
am sure she hates me, and the feeling grows
stronger every day. Oh, what shall I do?
what can I do! How is one to endure such a
state of things for a lifetime? I am not an old
woman. I may have to stay here for years and
years! If I could <i>only</i> get through with it all
and go to my home!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was not often that she indulged herself in
such moods, and she felt always distinctly self-condemned
when they were allowed to take
hold of her. She had never been one to indulge
herself in what her old friend Eurie Mitchell
used to characterize as &quot;useless whining&quot;;
and it would be beneath the mature Christian
to allow it.</p>

<p class="indent">But a crisis was at hand. Erskine surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
his family one afternoon by coming home several
hours earlier than usual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ran away!&quot; was his gay announcement
as he found his wife and mother in the living-room.
They had been entertaining a caller who
had asked first for Ruth, and then had insisted
upon seeing the young mother and the
baby.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such tiresome people!&quot; Irene had said
impatiently. &quot;Forever trying to pry into my
affairs! I wish they would at least let me have
my baby in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But she had ordered the nurse to bring him
down to her in a few minutes, for the callers
were Erskine&#39;s friends of long standing, and
she knew that he meant them to be treated with
all deference.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is great luck to find you both here,&quot;
Erskine said. &quot;It will save time. I escaped
from the office on purpose to enjoy a drive with
my family. It is just the day for Boy Junior,&quot;
and he tossed the delighted baby in his arms
as he spoke. &quot;It is as balmy as spring. Why,
this is a spring month, isn&#39;t it? I had
forgotten. Get ready, beloveds, and we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
have time for a glimpse of the bay before the
sun sets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; said Irene, hastily. &quot;Not today,
Erskine; I don&#39;t want to go. You can
take mother, and baby and I will stay at home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine looked surprised and troubled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why is that, dear? I planned on purpose
for you. I don&#39;t think you get out enough
in this sweet spring air. I could not help noticing
how pale and worn you looked this
morning. Don&#39;t you think so, mamma? Come,
dearest, it will do you good; and I have so little
time nowadays for driving with you. I have
been planning all the morning to get away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; Irene said fretfully.
But her husband took no notice of the
words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll go on a lark!&quot; he explained to the
delighted baby. &quot;Father and mother and
grandmother and grandson. How does that
sound, my boy? I feel like a boy myself to-day.
You and the little boy may have the back seat,
mommie, and your big girl and boy will sit in
front, and drive. Don&#39;t you want to drive,
Irene? The horses are in fine spirit, just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
you like them to feel when you have the
reins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, nurse,&quot; as that young woman appeared
at the moment in the doorway. &quot;Put this young
man into driving attire, while the ladies are getting
on their wraps. We mustn&#39;t waste another
minute of this glorious sunshine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But at this point the baby asserted himself.
The nurse had taken him from his father&#39;s arms
and was moving toward the door; as he passed
Ruth, he made a quick, unexpected spring in her
direction, and had not her arms been quick and
her grasp firm, there might have been an accident.
As it was, he cuddled in her embrace
with a gurgle of happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You young scamp!&quot; said the proud father,
with a relieved laugh. &quot;You knew where you
meant to land, didn&#39;t you? Showed excellent
taste, too. He is becoming to you, mommie.
You look young enough to-day to be mistaken
for his mother. Doesn&#39;t she, Irene?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For Ruth&#39;s cheeks had flushed like a girl&#39;s,
and her heart was beating swiftly under the
baby&#39;s caresses. She bent her head over the
golden one, and murmured some incoherent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
sentence, while she hid eyes that were filled with
tears. It was so rare a thing in these days to
get a chance to cuddle that baby!</p>

<p class="indent">And then Irene spoke, in a tone of voice that
her husband had rarely heard:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rebecca, I did not ring for you. Go away;
I will bring the baby myself. I <i>wish</i> you
wouldn&#39;t! I don&#39;t want him kissed nor
fondled. Give him to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This last, addressed to Ruth, in a tone so
sharp and a manner so rude that Erskine in
unbounded astonishment said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just that word, but not as she had ever
before heard it spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; she said. &quot;Let her leave
my baby alone. I don&#39;t want her to touch
him, and I won&#39;t have it! I <i>won&#39;t</i>! I say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice had risen almost to a scream.</p>

<p class="indent">Rebecca had disappeared with the swiftness
with which this woman&#39;s servants generally
obeyed her commands, and Ruth, putting the
baby without a word into his amazed father&#39;s
arms, fled away also.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXVI" id="chXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p class="h3">A STRANGE CHANGE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was no driving out that day; the
Burnham horses were remanded to the
stable with no other explanation to their astonished
care taker than that the ladies had
decided not to go out.</p>

<p class="indent">When Ruth, distressed and bewildered as to
what course to take, obeyed the tardy summons
to dinner, she found a stranger in the dining
room whom Erskine introduced as a member
of the Severn law firm, from town, who had
come out for a business conference. Would
she be kind enough to take Irene&#39;s place at table?
His wife, he explained to the guest, was the victim
of a severe headache and must be excused.</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the dinner Erskine was thoughtful
for and courteously attentive to his mother;
but of course there was no opportunity for a
personal word. When at last he excused himself
for a business conference and took his guest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
to the library, Ruth stood where he had left her,
irresolute and distressed. Under normal conditions
the proper and natural thing for a mother
whose daughter was suffering with headache
would be to go to her with sympathetic inquiries
and offers of help. Should she attempt this?
Would Erskine think it the right step for her
to take? She feared that she knew only too
well how Irene would receive her; but no
matter. The question was, What did Erskine
want? What did he think about it all? Did
he blame her for the strange exhibition he had
seen that afternoon? True, it was not more
than she had endured before, but it was a strange
experience to Erskine, and it would be only
natural for him to think that his wife must
have had strong provocation, in order to make
such an outburst possible. If he thought that,&mdash;if
he blamed her in any way, how would it be
possible ever to undeceive him? Wait&mdash;ought
she to undeceive him? Ought she even to exonerate
herself? Could she expect any man to
take sides against his wife? What a horrible
question! Could she want him to do such a
thing even for her? Oh, the misery of it all!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
That she and her son had reached the hour
when they could not explain to each other!</p>

<p class="indent">Only one thing seemed certain. She must
go away somewhere, and speedily. It must
now be apparent even to Erskine that they
could not continue longer in this way of living.</p>

<p class="indent">She crept back to her room, at last, and sat
in the darkness with hands closely clasped, so
closely that the diamond of her engagement
ring cut into the flesh. She listened for words
from across the hall, or for movements. She
went over and over and over the miserable scene
of the afternoon; she listened for Erskine, and
wondered if he would stop at her room, and was
afraid to have him come.</p>

<p class="indent">It was late when he came upstairs very quietly
and paused at his mother&#39;s door and listened; and
she was breathlessly still. Then he went on,
to his own rooms; and Ruth, physically exhausted,
went to her bed, and, in the course of
time, fell asleep, not having been able to come
to any decision as to what she could do.</p>

<p class="indent">The gray dawn of another day was beginning
to make faint shadows in the room, when a knock
at her door awakened her, and Erskine entered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
Was she awake? he inquired anxiously. It
was too bad to disturb her rest, but he must.
Irene was ill, very ill. Nurse was with her, and
the baby had awakened and was crying. Might
he bring him to her, and could she care for him
until they could plan how to manage?</p>

<p class="indent">Even in that moment of haste and anxiety
Ruth detected in her son&#39;s voice a kind of solemn
relief, almost of satisfaction, and read
its meaning. It was as if he had said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene is violently ill, is not herself, indeed,
and probably has not been for a long time. It is
plain that she was not responsible for what she
said or did yesterday.&quot; His mother could understand
that even such an explanation, sad
as it was, was balm to his soul. She sprang up
and began to dress in haste, while she answered
him. Of course she would care for Baby; bring
him at once; or wait, she would go for him herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go back to Irene,&quot; she commanded. &quot;She
may be needing you this minute; and you
needn&#39;t think of Baby again.&quot; How glad her
hungry arms were to enfold him, even at such
price, she would have been almost ashamed to
have had known.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
In this manner the dreaded day broke for
them; with all embarrassments forgotten and
all programmes of possible action swept away.
Irene was desperately ill. Rebecca, the baby&#39;s
nurse, who was a graduate of a training school,
and had done hospital service, admitted that it
looked like what she called &quot;a case.&quot; She
was willing to transfer her attentions entirely
to the mother, until other arrangements could
be made.</p>

<p class="indent">Then began in the Burnham household a new
and strange but very busy life. With incredible
promptness the house took on that indescribable
and distinctly felt change which serious illness
brings in its train. All ordinary routine was
suspended. The eight o&#39;clock car for which
Erskine was almost as sure to be ready as the
sun was to rise at a given moment, halted at the
corner for passengers as usual, but went on
without him. He came down to breakfast at
any hour when he could best get away from
Irene, and sometimes stood in the doorway,
coffee cup in hand, ready for a summons; for
Irene was as imperious in her delirium as she
had been in health. The house seemed to be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
the hands of physicians and nurses. As the
illness had from the first assumed a serious form,
a trained nurse had been at once secured, but it
proved necessary for Rebecca, also, to be in
almost constant attendance. This placed the
baby entirely in the care of his grandmother,
whose thankful and devoted service was his at
any hour of the day or night. While the machinery
of all the rest of the house was more
or less thrown out of gear, the people taking
their meals at any hour that chanced to be convenient
for them, and ordering all their movements
with a view to the sick room, Erskine
Burnham junior went on his serene and methodical
way. He was bathed and dressed and
breakfasted at his usual hours; he went out in
his carriage at the given time; he sat on the
porch in the sunshine at just such and such
periods, and was in every respect as serene and
sunny and well-cared-for a baby as though his
mother was not lying upstairs making a desperate
fight for life.</p>

<p class="indent">This state of things lasted for about three
weeks; then the alarming character of the illness
subsided, and by degrees, the long, slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
period of convalescence was entered upon, and
the house adjusted itself again to changed
conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">In kitchen and dining room something like
routine could once more be carried out; and
Erskine began to think of business, and even to
get away to his office for an hour or two each
day.</p>

<p class="indent">By and by the closely drawn shades below
stairs were raised, and flowers began to appear
in the vases.</p>

<p class="indent">But in Baby Erskine&#39;s apartments his grandmother
still reigned supreme. The special
trained nurse had departed, and Rebecca had
sole charge of the patient. A young nurse girl
had been secured at the first, to help with the
care of baby, under Ruth&#39;s supervision, and
she was proving herself a comfort.</p>

<p class="indent">Altogether, these days, full of responsibilities
though they were, and not without some anxieties,
held much comfort and even happiness
for Ruth. Erskine&#39;s baby was in her care, and
as often as she chose was in her arms; she could
fondle him as she would, without fear of reproof.
She could bathe and rub and clothe the perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
little body, she could curl the lovely golden rings
of hair about her fingers, she could catch him up
in a transport of bliss and kiss his lovely little
neck and dimpled chin and exquisite arms, and
in a thousand tender mother-ways rest her
heart upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">And the baby lavished love without measure
upon her, and clung to her when any attempt
was made to take him away, and made wild
little demonstrations of delight at her approach;
and all day she was happy.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only at night when he lay in his crib
near her bedside, sleeping quietly, that the
spectre of the near future came and sat with her
and set her heart to quivering. The days were
passing swiftly; each one was bringing nearer
the hour when she must give back her treasure
and banish herself. Where? She did not
know; she had not been able to decide. Somewhere
with Maybelle, if that could be brought
about; only&mdash;What could be said to Erskine?</p>

<p class="indent">Was it absolutely necessary? Was it possible
that this very serious illness, whose outcome
much of the time had been more than doubtful,
had wrought changes in Irene? Sometimes it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
almost seemed to her that such was the case;
and yet it might be only physical weakness that
made the difference.</p>

<p class="indent">Daily now, by the doctor&#39;s advice, Baby was
taken to his mother&#39;s room for a few minutes.
At first, Ruth sent the little maid with him, and
avoided going in at the same time, lest the baby&#39;s
demonstrations of delight over her would annoy
his mother. But one morning as she was passing
through the hall with Baby in her arms, the
door of the sick room opened, and Rebecca
called:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Burnham, will you please bring Baby
here a minute? His mother wants to see him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Ruth turned at once and carried him to the
bedside, where he, being in genial mood, chose
to smile upon and coo at his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He grows rapidly, doesn&#39;t he?&quot; Irene said,
and it was the first remark she had volunteered,
directed to her mother-in-law.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth had seen her twice a day ever since there
had been any admittance for other than those
in constant attendance, but her visits had necessarily
been very brief, and there had been no
attempt at conversation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; she made haste to say. &quot;He
is growing finely; you will be astonished to find
how strong he is, and he seems to be perfectly
well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does you credit.&quot; His mother&#39;s tone
was listlessness personified. Ruth, looking at
her closely, began to realize that some strange
change which seemed not to be accounted for
by illness had come upon Irene. It was not
simply that the fierceness of her love for her
child was gone, and almost if not quite indifference
taken its place, physical weakness might
account for that; but there was an indescribable
something about her that seemed to Ruth
like a surrender, as one who had made a fierce
fight and been worsted in the battle and had
given up. The troubled grandmother thought
it all over after she and baby were back in
his room. She could not but fear that a new
distress was coming upon them. What if Irene
were that abnormal creature, a woman who
could not continue to love a child, even her
own! There was no fear that she would again
desert it, her evident and unfailing, even increasing
passion for her husband would hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
her, this time, to her home; but&mdash;could the
misery of it be borne, if this baby must grow
up under the control of an unloving mother?
She strained him to her so suddenly and so
closely that he rebelled, and got off a lovely
jargon of talk in protest.</p>

<p class="indent">She went back, later, to Irene&#39;s room, carrying
the baby who was in a flutter of delight over
just the joy of living. It did not seem possible
that one could look at him without loving him.
She could not help wanting to test Irene and see
if her interest in him had indeed waned.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled languidly on him, and suffered
Ruth to place him on the couch beside her,
although she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two visits in one morning! Hasn&#39;t he been
here before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was so sweet in his new dress,&quot; Ruth
explained, &quot;that I thought his mamma ought
to see him while it was fresh.&quot; Then she
began to rehearse some of his pretty baby ways,
making a distinct effort to awaken in his mother&#39;s
heart a sense of pride in her child. Irene listened
vaguely, as one who only half heard.
Suddenly she made an impatient movement.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
&quot;Here,&quot; she said, &quot;take your baby. He is
so full of life that the very sight of him wearies
me. Take him away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth&#39;s heart sank. Better the fiercest, unreasoning
passion of love and jealousy than this!</p>

<p class="indent">Others beside herself began to notice and be
puzzled and troubled by this change in the
patient. Rebecca, the nurse, expressed her
mind to Ruth in anxious whispers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t it seem queer to you, ma&#39;am, that
she doesn&#39;t notice baby more? and he growing
so smart and cunning! You know how she was
just bound up in the child, and couldn&#39;t seem
to think of anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is because she is still so weak that she
cannot yet think connectedly about anything,&quot;
Ruth replied with a confidence that she was
far from feeling. &quot;You noticed, didn&#39;t you, that
she said he was so full of life it wearied her to
look at him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the nurse who had received hospital
training, shook her head and whispered again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t right, ma&#39;am, somehow. I&#39;m no
croaker but I&#39;ve seen lots of sick folks and I
don&#39;t think things are going just right with her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
If I were Mr. Burnham, I should want another
doctor to see her, or&mdash;something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then came Erskine, his face troubled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, did you ever see any one get well
as slowly as Irene does? It almost seems to
me as though she is weaker to-day than she was
two weeks ago; and she seems to take less and
less notice of Baby. Last night when I heard
him laughing, I asked her if she did not want
me to bring him for a little good-night visit, and
she said: &#39;No, I don&#39;t want him. I&#39;ve given
him up!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His voice broke with the last word, but he
waited for his mother to say something encouraging;
and she had only the merest commonplaces.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has been very ill, Erskine, and I suppose
we must be patient. She cannot be expected
to be interested in anything while she is still so
weak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, you don&#39;t think&mdash;&quot; and then
Ruth was glad that the baby cried, and she had
to go to him, without waiting to tell what she
thought.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXVII" id="chXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p class="h3">A RETROGRADE MOVEMENT</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Erskine,</span> once roused, could not rest. He
came to his mother on the next evening,
his face more troubled than before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, I had a long talk with the doctor
this morning. He is not satisfied with the
present state of things. He admits that for
some days there has been a retrograde movement.
He has been watching very closely and
has become convinced that there is some mental
disturbance, a heavy mental strain of some kind
that must be removed before medicine will be
of any use. Now what possible mental strain
could Irene have!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told the doctor that before we were married,
she went through very trying experiences, and
lost her nearest relative while she was alone in a
foreign country; but that time was long past,
of course, and there had been absolutely nothing
since, to trouble her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
His mother&#39;s start of dismay at hearing the
doctor&#39;s word, and the flushing of her face did
not escape him, and he added almost sternly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, are you keeping something from
me that I ought to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she did not know how to answer
him. Then her mind cleared and she spoke
quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am doing right, Erskine; I have no secrets
of my own from you. I have heard of
some things that I can conceive of as troubling
Irene, but she did not confide them to me, and
I have no right to talk about them even to you;
especially as I can think of no good, but rather
harm, to result.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned from her abruptly. She could see
that he was not only sorely perplexed but hurt;
in his hour of deepest need his mother seemed to
have failed him.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a bitter hour for her. Yet she felt that
she must be right. Would any one but a fiend
go to Erskine now with the story of his wife&#39;s
long years of living a lie! If her duty elsewhere
were but as clear as this! Could it be
that this was what was preying upon Irene and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
causing that retrograde movement? Had her
long-sluggish conscience awakened at last?
Was she perhaps ignorant of the fate of her
daughter? Was she afraid that her former
husband was still living, and that he and
Erskine might, sometime, meet? Who could
tell what questions of horror and terror were
struggling in her tired brain and wearing out
her weakened body?</p>

<p class="indent">Ought she&mdash;the woman who knew the whole
dread story, knew many details that the sick
one did not&mdash;ought she to be the surgeon to
probe that wound? To be able to talk about
it all might help. And yet&mdash;who could tell?
The knowledge that her husband&#39;s mother knew
every detail of that life which had been so carefully
hidden from them, might be the last
shock to that already overcharged brain.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, to be sure of her duty! She told herself
that she would perform it at any cost, she would
shrink from nothing, now, if she could but be
sure of the way. Well, why should she not be
sure? Where was her Father? What was that
promise: &quot;Thine ears shall hear a word behind
thee saying: &#39;This is the way, walk ye in it.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
Sleep did not come to her that night, but
perhaps she was given a strength that was
better. She spent much of the time on her knees
beside the quietly sleeping baby; and though,
when morning came, she was not sure which
way she was to turn that day, &quot;whether to the
right hand or the left,&quot; she found her mind
repeating the words: &quot;In quietness and confidence
shall be your strength.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The day passed without marked changes of
any sort. Erskine comforted himself with the
belief that Irene was a trifle stronger. He told
his mother that Dr. Sutherland was coming out
to see her on the following day. The great nerve
specialist could not get away from the city before
that time. Irene heard of his expected visit
with the same air of indifference that she had
exhibited toward all things of late. She lay
very quiet most of the day, and at evening made
no objection whatever to Erskine&#39;s going to an
important conference with his firm.</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner was he gone than she herself proposed
that Rebecca go at that time to the
kitchen to superintend the making of a new kind
of food for her, instead of waiting until morning.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
&quot;I might want to try it in the night,&quot; she said,
&quot;and I don&#39;t need any further attention at present.
Mother will stay with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This looked like deliberate planning. Irene
had never before, of her own will, arranged to
spend five minutes alone with her mother-in-law.
That astonished woman while hastening to
agree to the proposition, made a swift mental
claim upon the promise: &quot;Thine ears shall hear
a word behind thee saying, This is the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Irene who began conversation as soon
as the door closed after Rebecca. But the
topic she chose was a new astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been thinking about those two step-daughters
of yours, Seraph and Minta. You
must have lived a strange life with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth turned surprised eyes upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not suppose that you had ever heard
of the girls,&quot; she said. &quot;Erskine was so young
when they left us that I thought he scarcely
remembered them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he remembers them very well. He has
told me some things; but it was Mrs. Portland
from whom I received their connected history.
She was here for two months while you were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
away, and was quite intimate with me; she
ran in often, and liked nothing better than to
talk about you and those two girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Mrs. Portland was an old resident of
the neighborhood who had known Judge Burnham
and his daughters before Ruth had heard
of their existence. What she could reveal of
their history if she chose, would leave nothing
for another to tell. The question was, Why had
their story interested this sick woman? Or
rather, why was it being brought forward just
now?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems strange that they both came back
to you to die, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was certainly a strange way of putting it!
Ruth hesitated how to reply. At last, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seraph never left home, you know; and poor
Minta was glad to return to it. She had been
through a very bitter experience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I heard about it. You have had all
sorts of experiences yourself, haven&#39;t you?
And to conclude with a good-for-nothing daughter-in-law
seems too bad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Surprise and almost consternation held Ruth
silent. This was so utterly unlike any sentence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
that she had expected! Irene&#39;s tone expressed
both sympathy and regret. Ruth decided to
pass it off lightly. She laughed a little in a way
that was intended to express good cheer, as she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not to find fault with my daughter-in-law,
if you please! I allow no one to do
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is because you are not acquainted with
her yourself. You don&#39;t know anything about
her. You think you do, but you are mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no excitement in her tone; there
was even no indication that she had a personal
interest in the conversation; it seemed to be a
mere statement of fact.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth&#39;s swift thought took hold of the promise
and heard the voice: &quot;This is the way.&quot;
She spoke with quiet firmness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know all about her; I know a great deal
more than she thinks I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene moved on her pillow so as to get a more
direct view of the other&#39;s face as she asked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just that, dear. I know much more than
you think, and have known it for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
&quot;You don&#39;t know what I mean,&quot; the tone
was still impersonal, &quot;but I am going to tell you.
You think I was a widow when I married your
son. I was not.&quot; She raised herself slightly
on one elbow as she spoke, using more strength
than she had exerted since her illness. Ruth
came swiftly over to her and slipped a supporting
arm under her as she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t try to raise yourself up, Irene, and I
wouldn&#39;t talk any more. I know all that you
want to tell me. You were a divorced wife, and
your husband was living; but he has since died.
You see I understand all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene&#39;s eyes fairly pierced her with their
keenness; still, her voice betrayed no emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You knew it all the time?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have known it for a very long time, Irene.
Don&#39;t talk any more; it is time for your medicine
now, and after it you must be very quiet,
you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was as one who had not heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not know the worst,&quot; she said, still
speaking as though her words were about some
one else; but she was deathly pale. &quot;There was
a child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
Ruth hurriedly wet a cloth in a restorative and
bathed her face, while she spoke low and soothingly,
as to a child.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know; there was a dear little girl,
who is a young woman now,&mdash;one of the sweetest,
dearest girls in the world. I know her and
love her. Irene, for Erskine&#39;s sake, won&#39;t you
try to be careful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For Irene had pushed the soothing hand away
and was making a fierce effort to raise herself
to a sitting posture, and her eyes looked to Ruth
for the first time like Maybelle&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth hurried her words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know all that you want to say; you must
lie quiet and let me talk. I am sure there must
have been strong provocation, and you were
very young; I know how bitterly you must
have regretted it all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot know that, at least,&quot; she said.
&quot;There is no need for what you call future
punishment, I have had mine here; and I have
hated you for fear you would find me out.
How long have you known it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For a long time, many months. Irene, I
<i>cannot</i> let you talk or think about it now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
Won&#39;t you try to put it all away for to-night?
There is nothing, you see, that you need to
tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The great solemn eyes that Maybelle&#39;s were
like when she was troubled were fixed upon
Ruth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could you put it away?&quot; she asked. &quot;It
has never been away from me for a moment,
the fear that Erskine would&mdash;would&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A convulsive shiver ran through her frame,
as of one in physical pain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Ruth, in terror, &quot;this is all wrong!
If you are worse, Erskine will never forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene made a visible effort to control herself,
and lay with closed eyes, and motionless, allowing
Ruth to bathe her face and make hot applications
to her hands and feet. After a little,
she spoke, quietly enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will talk quietly, but you must let me
talk, now. I have kept it to myself just as
long as I can. Since Baby came, my life has
been a daily terror. Will you tell me how you
came to know about me, and why you have not
told Erskine? I am sure you have not, but I
do not understand why.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
&quot;Because,&quot; said Ruth, solemnly, &quot;Jesus
Christ, to whom I belong, told me not to do so.
It is your secret, Irene, yours and His. You
must let Him tell you what to do with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene gazed at her. &quot;You are a strange
woman,&quot; she said at last, &quot;a very strange
woman; but you are good, and I have not
understood you. I am sorry that I hated you.
If I had understood, it might have been&mdash;different.
I thought you would find it out, sometime,
women always do, and I hated you for that;
I dreaded you, you know. Every letter that
came from you while you were away made me
faint and sick because of what might be in it.
I was afraid to have Erskine come home at night
because of what he might have heard; and I
was afraid to have him go away again in the
morning for fear it would be the last time he
would kiss me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor child!&quot; The words were wrung from
Ruth&#39;s heart,&mdash;the first words of real tenderness
that she had ever spoken to this woman.</p>

<p class="indent">Again there came that strange new look into
Irene&#39;s eyes.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 399px;">

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">I&#39;m sorry that I hated you.</span>&quot;&mdash;<i>Page 354.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a good woman,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
am sorry that I hated you. Let me talk now,
and tell you about it. I have got to! I ought
not to have married that man; I never pretended
even to him that I loved him. I married
to get rid of dulness and restraint, and to go
to Europe. I was a young fool! I got rid of
nothing, and instead of feeling only indifference
for him I learned to hate him. He was a
drunkard, and I hated him for that. Then&mdash;I
did not like the baby. You can&#39;t quite control
your horror of that, can you? I don&#39;t wonder,
now that I have learned what mother-love
really is. I could almost hate myself for having
such a feeling. You think a mother couldn&#39;t&mdash;but
she can. I turned from the child, just as I
had from the father, in disgust. Even so early
in her life she looked like him, and I hated him.
He was a weak man, and I never had any patience
with weakness. Sometimes he was maudlin
and loving, and then I hated him worst of
all. One day I went away from him and
stayed away. That was all I did. Oh, yes, I
got a divorce; that was because I hated his
name. At first I meant to do something for
the child, I didn&#39;t know what,&mdash;he worshipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
the baby,&mdash;and then I heard that it died; and
I did not know until years afterward that it
lived; but it was too late then to do anything.
By that time I had met Erskine and discovered
what love really meant. Oh, to think how I
have loved him! and I have struggled and
planned and lied to keep his love! I have even
prayed to keep it! and now it is all over!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene,&quot; said her listener, firmly. &quot;If you
persist in talking, I shall have to send for Erskine.
You must swallow this sedative and
then lie still and let me talk. I will say in just
a minute all I want to, and then we will both be
quiet and you will try to sleep, for Erskine&#39;s
sake. It isn&#39;t all over; it is just beginning.
We cannot undo the past, but we can make
another thing of the present&mdash;and the future.
I promise you, before God, and call on Him to
witness, that I will never by word or look
reveal to Erskine one word of what we have said
or of what I know, unless you tell me to do so.
When you are well and strong again, you will
decide how much or how little you want to
tell him. God will show you what is right and
you will want to do right; I am sure of it. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span>
we will love each other, you and I, and help
each other. Two women who love one man as
you and I love Erskine Burnham should be very
much to each other. Now I am not going to
say another word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She bent her head and kissed the sick woman
on her forehead&mdash;her first voluntary caress.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene, who had closed her eyes and was death-like
in her stillness, opened them again and
looked steadily at her. Then she said with
slow conviction in her tones:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a good woman.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXVIII" id="chXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p class="h3">&quot;SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">But</span> Ruth Burnham went to her room that
night in a tumult of pain and self-reproach
keener than she had felt for years.</p>

<p class="indent">As plainly as though a book had been opened
before her, and a solemn unseen figure had
pointed to the page, she read the story of her
failure.</p>

<p class="indent">She had tried to be good to this woman, she
had been outwardly patient with her faults,
she had been long suffering, she had been silent
over wrongs&mdash;she had effaced herself in a
thousand ways, but she had been as cold as ice.
There had been nothing in her face or voice
to invite the confidence of this younger, weaker
woman. There had been nothing in her daily
attitude toward her to suggest the love and
sympathy of Christ.</p>

<p class="indent">She cried to Him for forgiveness, for the privilege
of beginning again, for wisdom to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
just how to do it. And then she prayed for
Irene in a way that, with all her trying, she had
not been able to do before.</p>

<p class="indent">It came to her while on her knees that she
would tell Irene of Maybelle&#39;s beautiful faith
and daily praying for her mother, without knowing
that it was her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Were the child&#39;s prayers being answered?
Was this strange new mood of Irene&#39;s part of
the answer?</p>

<p class="indent">But they could not be brought together, that
mother and daughter, not now&mdash;it was too late.
How could they? What explanation of her
existence, of their intense interest in her, could
be given to Erskine? Would Irene ever be
intensely interested in Maybelle? Could she do
other than shrink from her now, after all these
strange years?</p>

<p class="indent">Oh! there were depths to this trouble that
she must not try to touch. But one thing was
plain: she must help Irene. Whatever would
do that, at whatever sacrifice, must be done.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day, that in some way Ruth had
thought would be an eventful one, passed in
even unusual quiet. Irene seemed less restless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span>
than usual, and lay much of the time with closed
eyes. The great specialist came out to see her,
and there was a long interview, and a long conference
afterward with the attending physician,
but they kept their own counsel. All that the
family knew was that in the main they agreed,
and the specialist wished to withhold his final
opinion until he saw the patient again after
thirty-six hours.</p>

<p class="indent">In the evening Irene roused herself from what
had for several hours been almost a stupor, to
ask Erskine if he could give the entire evening
to her, and if they could be quite alone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; he said with a brave attempt
at gayety. &quot;We will banish them all, even Rebecca,
and I will be doctor and head nurse and
errand boy combined. See that you get a good
sleep, Rebecca, and you need not come until
I ring for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To Ruth this arrangement was somewhat of
a disappointment. She had hoped that Irene
would want to see her for a few minutes; there
were questions that it would seem as though she
must want to ask, and there were things that
Ruth felt might help her, if she were told them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
But Irene gave no hint that she even remembered
what had passed between them, save
that, as Ruth went to bid her good-night, she
made a movement with her hand to draw her
down and murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a good woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine held the door open for his mother to
pass, then followed her into the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, don&#39;t you think Irene has seemed
a little better to-day, more quiet? And she
took a good deal of notice of Baby this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was such a wistful note in his voice
that his mother&#39;s eyes filled with tears; she
longed to comfort him, and realized that she
did not know how.</p>

<p class="indent">She was wakeful and alert during the first part
of the night, ready for some emergency which
she feared, without knowing just why. But
toward morning she slept heavily, and was
wakened by the sunshine and the prattle of
Baby&#39;s voice in his crib at her bedside.</p>

<p class="indent">She dressed hurriedly, still with that vague
impression upon her that something had happened
or was about to happen. In the hall was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
Erskine, standing with folded arms gazing out
of the window; gazing at nothing. The first
glimpse she had of him she knew that something
had already happened. His face was gray, not
white, with a pallor that was unnatural and
startling; he gave her a strange impression of
having grown suddenly old&mdash;years older than he
had been the night before. And he looked
strangely like his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine,&quot; his mother said, alarmed, and
hurried toward him.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned at once, lifting a warning finger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; he said; &quot;I think she is sleeping.
She has been very quiet since midnight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he went without another word into his
dressing-room and closed the door.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a strange long day. The patient lay
quiet, not sleeping all the time, but like one too
weak and too indifferent to life to move. The
house was kept very still; although noises did
not seem to disturb the sick one, the different
members of the household conversed in mono-syllables
and in whispers when they met.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth kept the baby out all day in the lovely
soft summer air, and he was happy. When a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
tear rolled once or twice down the cheeks of his
grandmother, he kissed her lovingly, and patted
her face with his soft hand. The specialist
came again, but he did not stay long, and Ruth,
who could not leave her charge at the time, did
not know what he said. No one came to her
with any word. One of the maids told her that
Mr. Burnham was sitting beside his wife, and
had not left her room for hours.</p>

<p class="indent">The afternoon shadows were growing long,
and Ruth was explaining to the baby that it was
almost time for him to go to his little bed, and
that she did not know whether mamma could
kiss him good-night or not, when Rebecca, her
face swollen with weeping, crossed the lawn and
touched her arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I take Baby, ma&#39;am? The doctor said
perhaps you would want to go to Mr. Burnham.
He went into his dressing-room and closed his
door, and the doctor thinks perhaps you might
help him; he was awfully pale.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is any thing wrong?&quot; Ruth asked hurriedly,
as she rose up to give her charge into Rebecca&#39;s
arms. &quot;Is she worse?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Rebecca was crying. &quot;Oh, ma&#39;am,&quot; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
said, &quot;she just slipped away! it was awfully
sudden for him! the doctor told him she might
live for hours, I heard him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rebecca, she is not <i>dead</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She just stopped breathing, ma&#39;am, and that
was all. Mr. Burnham was sitting close to her
where he has been sitting &#39;most all day, and she
didn&#39;t look any different to me. I thought she
was asleep; but he looked up suddenly at the
doctor, poor man, with <i>such a face</i>! I never
shall forget it! and the doctor said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes, she is gone.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then Rebecca, who had not loved her
mistress devotedly in life, broke into bitter weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth was like one paralyzed. She stood
gazing at the girl as though unable to move. It
was not Erskine&#39;s grief so much as her own
consternation that held her. It seemed to her
impossible that Irene was dead! With all her
thinking, and her foreboding, she had not
thought of that. She had felt on the eve of a
great calamity, but it had not been death.
Erskine&#39;s gray, pale face that morning had not
suggested such trouble. Instead, she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span>
worried herself all day long with the possibilities
connected with that evening conference;
of what Irene had told him, and how he had
borne it and what he would feel must be done.</p>

<p class="indent">She went to Erskine at last, utterly in doubt
what to say to him. He was in his private
study with his head bowed on the desk. He did
not notice his mother&#39;s entrance by so much as
a movement. She went over to him and laid
her hand gently on the brown curly locks,
with a caressing movement familiar to him from
childhood. He put out a hand and drew her
to him, but neither of them spoke a word.</p>

<p class="indent">A tender memory of the long ago came to
Ruth. She was back in the days of Erskine&#39;s
childhood, she was in that very study which had
been his father&#39;s, with her head bowed in anguish
on her husband&#39;s desk, while he lay in the room
below dressed for the grave. Her little boy
stood beside her, a longing desire upon him to
comfort his mother; and half frightened because
she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma,&quot; he had said at last, hesitatingly,
&quot;Mamma, does God sometimes make a mistake?&quot;
It had come to her like a voice of tender reproof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span>
from God himself, and had helped her as nothing
else did. Long afterward she had told the
boy about it, and it had become a sacred memory
to them both.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine,&quot; she said at last, speaking very
tenderly;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does God sometimes make a mistake?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His strong frame shook. &quot;O mother!&quot; he
said. &quot;<i>O mother!</i>&quot; and lifted tearless eyes to
her face. How old he looked, and haggard!
How like to his father his face had grown!</p>

<p class="indent">Just then there came one of those commonplace
interruptions from which in times of mortal
stress we shrink away. The intrusive world
knocked at his door with its questions, and thrust
duties and responsibilities upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Did Mr. Burnham wish this, or that, or the
other? Could Dr. Cartwright speak to him a
moment? It was a matter of importance.
Would he see Miss Stuart for just a minute
about a telegram?</p>

<p class="indent">It was harrowing. His mother&#39;s heart ached
for him. The interruptions to his grief seemed
impertinent and trivial, and those who were
nearest to him deplored them as they always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
do, without realizing that the commonplaces of
life are often salvation to desperate souls.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine rose up to meet the demands upon
him, putting back with stern hand all outward
exhibition of his misery save that which his
face told for him.</p>

<p class="indent">He gave careful attention to the thousand
details that pressed upon him. He planned and
arranged and carried out, when necessary,
saving his mother all the burdens possible, but
it seemed to her that he avoided seeing her
alone.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not until Irene&#39;s body had been lying
for an entire week in the family burial ground
that Erskine came to his mother&#39;s room one
afternoon and asked if she were engaged.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only with Baby,&quot; she said eagerly. &quot;Come
in, Erskine, and see how sweet he is. You
haven&#39;t seen him since morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took the child in his arms and studied
his face intently, smiling over his pretty motions
in a grave, absent-minded way; then he gave
him back with a question:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you banish him, mamma, for a little
while? I want to talk with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; she said. &quot;Rebecca can take
him for a walk. I will have him ready in a
few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He watched the process of robing and kissing,
with eyes that seemed not to see; and that
troubled his mother, they were so full of pain.</p>

<p class="indent">When the baby was gone, and Ruth had
closed the doors leading into other rooms and
seated herself near to him, he seemed to have
forgotten that he wanted to talk.</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes were fixed on the far-away hills that
towered skyward, and were snow-capped; and
yet she was not sure that he saw them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother,&quot; he said at last, &quot;she told me you
were a good woman, and it is true. I have always
been able to anchor to you. We have
trusted each other utterly, you and I, and spoken
plainly to each other; we must always do so.
You have something to tell me. Will you begin
at the beginning and let me have all that you
know? Don&#39;t try to spare me, please; I want
the whole. O mother! If I had only known
long ago, it might have been&mdash;different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no reply that she could make to
this.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg&nbsp;369]</span>
After a moment, he said again: &quot;You know
that I am not blaming you, don&#39;t you? It was
what I might have expected of you, what you
did; she thought it was wonderful. But if she
could only have trusted me!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you tell me the whole, mamma? Irene
told me to ask you; she said you would not tell
it without her word. I mean about the man,
and&mdash;the child; all the details. How did
you hear of it all, and when?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated over the simple words, his face
flushing painfully. Ruth hurried her speech
to save him further effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember, Erskine, when our old
acquaintance Mamie Parker called upon me?
It was then that I heard the story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a gesture of astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamie Parker! Is it possible that she is
mixed up in our family matters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She found the little girl without other care
than a father could give, and interested herself
in her, and loved her. She has been thus far
in the child&#39;s life as dear and wise a friend as a
girl could have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she began at the beginning and gave in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span>
minutest detail the whole story, as it had come
to her at first, and as she had since lived it with
Maybelle.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine&#39;s amazement at the discovery that
the young girl to whom his mother had been
summoned by telegram, and for whom she had
cared ever since, was the one whose life-story
he was now hearing, was only equalled by his
pain in it all. But after the first dismayed exclamation
he sat like a statue, his face partially
hidden by his hand, interrupting neither by
question nor comment.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth purposely made her story long that he
might have time to get the control of himself;
and she tried to make Maybelle&#39;s loveliness of
heart and mind and person glow before him;
under the spell of the thought that it would all
be less terrible to him, if he could realize that
his dead wife&#39;s strange conduct had not ruined
the young life.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXIX" id="chXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p class="h3">RENUNCIATION</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> she stopped speaking because there
was nothing more to be told, they sat
for a little in utter silence.</p>

<p class="indent">When at last Erskine spoke in a low, carefully
controlled voice, he asked the very last
question that his mother expected.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How soon do you think she could come to us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot; Ruth&#39;s astonishment blurred for
the moment her penetration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother! whom could I mean? The child.
She must be sent for; she must come at once;
or, at least as soon as a suitable escort can be
secured. Would she come? And would she
stay, do you think? I mean would she stay
willingly? Oh, mamma, surely you will help me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine, dear boy, what do you want to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My duty.&quot; He withdrew his shielding
hand and his pallid lips made an effort to smile;
then grew grave again, taking almost stern lines.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg&nbsp;372]</span>
&quot;She is my wife&#39;s daughter; and as such I
stand now in the place of father to her. As fully
as it is possible for me to do so, now, I want to
fill that place. To provide for her, to take care
of her in any and every way that she may
need care; to have my home hers as fully
as it is our little son&#39;s.&quot; His voice broke
there, and for a moment he was still. Then he
went on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You said you loved her; it would not be
unpleasant to you to have her here, would it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then his mother found her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine, Maybelle has a place in my heart
second only to Baby&#39;s, and I would like so much
to have her with me, that at one time I tried to
plan a little home where we could be together.
But&mdash;do you realize the situation, do you
think? We cannot live entirely to ourselves,
you know, we have friends; and we have neighbors
who ask questions. If Maybelle comes to
us, to remain, what is to be said to them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The truth, mamma; never anything but
truth. She is my wife&#39;s daughter by a former
marriage, the half-sister of my boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine, dear son, I must hurt you, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[pg&nbsp;373]</span>
afraid; but do you realize what the truth will
be to the child? She loves her dead father with
such love as I believe few girls give, and she
cherishes in her inmost heart an ideal mother
who has been invested with more than human
qualities; if you could hear her talk about that
dear, dead mother, you would understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had shielded his face again, and was quiet
so long, that it seemed to her she could not bear
it. At last he spoke, huskily but with firmness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand, mamma, more than you think;
at least I believe I realize something of her feeling;
but&mdash;I cannot help it. Truth must be
spoken; the real must take the place of the ideal.
Isn&#39;t it so in all our lives? I promised her dead
mother that it should be so. It was perhaps a
morbid feeling,&mdash;some might think so,&mdash;but in
any case, she felt it; she said that she could not
die without my promise that the truth should
be made plain to the girl, and that she should be
told the very words that her mother said, at
the last. And I believe she was right,&quot; he
added firmly after another moment of silence,
&quot;I will speak only truth about it all, so help me
God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg&nbsp;374]</span>
Never was summons more joyfully received on
the part of a young girl than the one that called
Maybelle to the distant home of her newest and,
as she phrased it, &quot;almost&quot; her best friend.</p>

<p class="indent">The night preceding her departure she spent
with the Roberts family, where together they
went over the situation as they understood it,
for Erskine Roberts&#39;s benefit.</p>

<p class="indent">That young man had just arrived for a few
days&#39; vacation and could not be said to approve
of the new plans.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why is Aunt Ruth in such terrific haste?&quot;
he grumbled. &quot;She has never mentioned a visit
to you before this, has she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Maybelle, her bright face shading
for a moment. &quot;She never said a word about
it; but you know it is all very different now.
She is alone; I mean there is no other woman,
and there is a dear baby to be thought about;
I don&#39;t positively know, but I cannot help hoping
that she needs me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle&#39;s tones had become so jubilant that
they made Erskine gloomy and sarcastic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For nurse girl you mean, I suppose,&quot; he
said savagely. &quot;And if that delightful arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg&nbsp;375]</span>
should be found convenient for them, I
suppose you would stay on indefinitely?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Erskine,&quot; said his mother, smiling, &quot;don&#39;t
be a bear! she hasn&#39;t promised to stay forever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Maybelle, her color much heightened,
tried to explain further. &quot;The reason for such
haste is so I can have one of Mr. Burnham&#39;s
partners for an escort. It was found that he
had to come East on a hurried business
trip, and of course it was an unusual opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should hope so!&quot; grumbled the discontented
youth. &quot;And who is there to escort you
back? I&#39;ll venture they haven&#39;t planned for
that!&quot; Then suddenly he bent toward the
girl, ostensibly for the purpose of returning to
her the letter that had dropped to the floor,
and spoke for her ear alone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you how we will manage that, Maybelle.
I will come for you myself, if you will
let me. Will you let me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A vivid crimson mounted to the very forehead
of the fair-faced girl, and she seemed at a loss
how to reply; but she certainly had not been
troubled by his appeal whatever it was, so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
indulgent mother slipped away and left the
young people to themselves.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I to tell her, Erskine?&quot; Ruth had
asked her son, on the day that she was to go to
the station to meet Maybelle. He shook his
head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, mamma, no, I will not make it harder
for you than is necessary. Yes, I know only
too well how surely you would do everything
for me if you could; but&mdash;I have assumed an
obligation, and I do not mean to shirk it in the
slightest particular. Do not tell her anything
save that you wanted her&mdash;that is true, is it
not?&quot; he broke off to ask anxiously. &quot;Then, in
the evening, when she has had time to become
somewhat rested from her journey, send her to
me in my library and I will manage the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">How he managed it, or what took place during
that interview which must have been strangely
tragic some of the time, Ruth never fully knew.
She asked no questions, and what her son and
the girl revealed to her in scraps and detached
expressions afterward, suggested a confidence
so sacred that even she must not invade it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span>
She had known by the start and the swift
look of pain which swept over Erskine&#39;s face
when he first met Maybelle at the dinner table,
that the girl in her radiant beauty suggested his
dead wife. To Ruth there was a strange unlikeness
to the face that she had not loved; but
her heart was able to understand how Irene
had been to one whom she had loved, nay worshipped,
as she had her husband, a very different
being, living a life solely for him, and leaving a
memory that the fair girl could awaken.</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle was all but overwhelmed with astonishment
and a sweet timidity when Ruth
told her that Erskine wanted to see her for a
little while in his library.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not alone!&quot; she said. &quot;Without you, I
mean? Oh! Am I not almost afraid? I mean,
I shall not know what to say to him. It is all
so recent, you see. I can see his beautiful
character shining through his sorrow; dear
Mrs. Burnham, I admire him almost as much as
even his mother could wish, but I can see that
a great crushing sorrow is heavy upon him, and
a girl like me does not know how to touch such
wounds without hurting. Does he mean to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg&nbsp;378]</span>
talk to me about her, do you think? Does he
know that I loved her and prayed for her all
the time? Oh, dear friend, don&#39;t you think he
wants you too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth kissed her tenderly, solemnly, and put
her away from her. &quot;No, dear,&quot; she said gently.
&quot;He wants to see you quite alone. He has something
to tell you. You will know what to
say after you have heard him; God will show
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She closed the door after the slowly moving,
half-reluctant, serious girl, and sat alone. It
came to her vaguely, as one used to sacrifice,
that here was another. She must sit alone
with folded hands while another, and she a
young girl upon whom he had never before
set eyes, went down with her son into the depths
of human pain. Was it always so? Was that
forever the lot of motherhood, to stand aside
and have some one else touch the deepest life
of her children, whether in joy or pain?</p>

<p class="indent">The interview was long, very long. Sometimes
it seemed to the waiting mother that she
could not endure the strain; that she must go to
that closed room and discover for herself what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg&nbsp;379]</span>
those two were saying to torture each other.
But at last, the door across the hall opened and
Maybelle came with swift feet and knelt in
front of her, hid her face in the older woman&#39;s
lap, and broke into a passion of weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Ruth let the storm of pain roll on unchecked,
only touching the bowed head with
soothing hand and murmuring:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor child! dear little girl!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the girl cried on, and on, as though she
would never stop, her whole slight frame
shaken with the force of her sorrow.</p>

<p class="indent">Across the hall Ruth could hear the steady
tread of her son&#39;s footsteps as he paced back
and forth, fighting his battle alone. Should
his mother go and try to comfort him? But
this motherless one was clinging to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybelle,&quot; she said at last, &quot;is it a hopeless
grief? Is there no One who can help?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the girl made a desperate effort to control
herself. She reached for Ruth&#39;s hand and
gripped it in her young, strong one. Then,
after another moment, she spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me. I did not mean to hurt you;
I did not mean to cry at all; I said that I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg&nbsp;380]</span>
not; but it was all so new, so&mdash;O mamma,
mamma!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The head, which had been raised a little,
went down again; and the exceeding bitterness
of that last wailing cry of renunciation Ruth
never forgot. She had grace to be thankful
that the mother was not there to hear it.</p>

<p class="indent">But the violence of the storm was over, at
least so far as its outward exhibition was concerned.
In a few minutes more the girl spoke
quietly enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is very, very good. I did not know that
any&mdash;just human being could be so good.
And he spoke tenderly all the time of&mdash;of my
mother. I could feel in his voice the sound of
his great love for her. My poor, poor mother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Later, after much had been said and there
had been silence between them for a few minutes,
she spoke suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He asked me to call him &#39;father,&#39; he said he
wanted it.&quot; Ruth could not suppress a little
start of surprise and&mdash;was it pain? In all her
hours of thinking over this whole tragedy, trying
to plan how all things would be, she had not
thought of this. Yet it was like Erskine; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg&nbsp;381]</span>
utmost atonement that he could make, in word
as well as deed, would be made.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you say in reply?&quot; she asked the
waiting girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said that I would try to do in all
things just as he advised. I could not do
less, Mrs. Burnham; he is very good. I told
him about my own dear papa, and that I should
always, <i>always</i> love and honor him as I had reason
to; and he was good about that, too; he said
that the way I felt about him was not only
natural but it was right, and that he honored me
for it. Then he spoke of Baby Erskine and called
him my little brother; and that broke my heart.
I have so longed to have some one of my very
own. Mrs. Burnham, do you think perhaps
that&mdash;that papa understands about it all,
and would want me to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed unable to express her thought in
words, but Ruth understood it, and the yearning
wistfulness in the child&#39;s voice was not to be
resisted. The older woman put aside her own
pain to comfort and counsel this girl who had
certainly in strange ways been thrust upon her
care.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[pg&nbsp;382]</span>
A thought of comfort came to her, that, after
a little hesitation, she gave to the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybelle dear, if you call my son &#39;father,&#39;
what name does that give to me as my rightful
possession?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had her reward. There was a moment&#39;s
wondering thought, then a flush of surprise
and a wave of radiance swept over the expressive
face. She spoke the word in a whisper,
almost a reverent one, yet the syllables were
like a caress, and thrilled with joy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Grandmother&#39;! Oh! do you mean it?
that I may?&quot; And then the caresses that Ruth
received were almost as sweet as any that she
was waiting for Baby Erskine to voluntarily
bestow upon her.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXX" id="chXXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p class="h3">&quot;TWO, AND TWO, AND TWO&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> took but a little while for the Burnham
household to settle down quietly to routine
living; so easily, after all, does human nature
adjust itself to tremendous strains and changes.
Maybelle fitted into her place as though she had
always been an acknowledged daughter of the
house, come home after long absence. And the
neighbors, even those morbidly curious ones, of
which there are always a few in every community,
took kindly to the new order of things
and to the bright-faced stranger who rode and
drove and walked and appeared in church with
Erskine and his mother, and was introduced with
punctilious care as &quot;My wife&#39;s daughter, Miss
Somerville.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They could not help, even from the first,
saying kind and complimentary things about
the beautiful young face, and after a few days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[pg&nbsp;384]</span>
of wonderment and conjecture they arranged
their own story&mdash;with a very meagre array of
facts to build upon&mdash;quite to their satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, I knew she was a widow when he
married her; but I never heard of a child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he married abroad, don&#39;t you know,
and I suppose the girl just stayed on, with her
relatives. Her mother must have been a mere
child when she was first married; though this
girl is very young, and Mrs. Burnham was probably
older than she looked; for that matter,
don&#39;t you know, I always said that she looked
older than her husband? I suppose the girl
has lived abroad all her life; that&#39;s what makes
her look different, some way, from American
girls, though her mother was born in this country,
she told me so. Still, the girl would have
English ways, of course, always living there.
Did you hear her say the other day that the
Somerville brothers, great English bankers that
Ned Lake was asking her about, were her uncles?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems hard that the poor girl couldn&#39;t
have been with her mother before she died,&quot;
said one whose interests ran naturally in other
channels than those of ages and pedigrees.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[pg&nbsp;385]</span>
&quot;Yes, it does,&quot; chimed in another home-keeping
and home-loving matron, &quot;but then her
death was awfully sudden. Erskine&#39;s mother
told me that they had no idea of her dying up
to the very day; and I guess the girl has been
separated from her a good deal. I have heard
somewhere, and I am sure I don&#39;t remember
where, that there was a fuss of some sort in the
family. Probably her first husband&#39;s people
didn&#39;t like the idea of her going into society and
marrying again, especially marrying an American;
English people are queer about some things,
I have heard; I suppose they held on to the
girl as long as they could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, with supposition and surmise, and a
stray fact now and then, and vague remembrances,
the story was worked over and shaped
and pieced until it suited them. Meantime, the
Burnham family went quietly on its way, having
no confidants, and, while they spoke only
truth when they spoke at all, judging it not
necessary to tell the whole truth to any.</p>

<p class="indent">So quiet and peace settled once more upon
Ruth Burnham&#39;s home, and it was proved again,
as it often is, that a new grave in the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg&nbsp;386]</span>
burial ground is more productive of peace than
a life has been.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine was habitually grave, and his mother
told herself sorrowfully that sin, not death, had
permanently shadowed his life. But by degrees
his gravity took on a cheerful tone, and Baby
Erskine, whom at first he had almost shunned,
became a never failing source of comfort to him.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Maybelle, no grown-up daughter was
ever more devoted to a father&#39;s interests than she
became. She hovered about his home life with
an air of sweet, grave deference, ministering to
his tastes with unlimited thoughtfulness and
tact, until from being to him an infliction for
whose comfort he must be thoughtful from a
sense of duty, she became first an interest, and
then almost a necessity. The neighbors said
how lovely it was in her to take her mother&#39;s
place so beautifully.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, of course, there were some to say that
they shouldn&#39;t wonder if she should succeed at
last in comforting him entirely for his loss.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if he should marry her!
Of course she was really not related to him at
all, and great difference in age was much more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg&nbsp;387]</span>
common than it used to be. For that matter,
Erskine Burnham was still a young man. For
their part, they agreed almost to a woman,
that it would be a nice idea&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">But all that was before they made the acquaintance
of Erskine Roberts. That young
man was true to his word, and in the course
of time came across the continent. That he
came after Maybelle, as he had said he would,
was perfectly obvious, but he did not take her
back with him, as at one time he had tried to
plan to do.</p>

<p class="indent">He had two more years to spend at the theological
seminary, and during those two years it
had been agreed by all concerned that Maybelle
was to continue to bless her new home
with her presence.</p>

<p class="indent">Erskine Roberts was one of the very few to
whom the whole situation had been fully and
carefully explained. Not only Maybelle, but
Ruth herself had written the story, both to
Erskine, and his mother; and then, when his
namesake came out to them, the other Erskine
had him into his private room one evening,
and as he believed was his duty toward the man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg&nbsp;388]</span>
who was to make Maybelle his wife, went down
with him into the lowest depths of his life tragedy.
And Erskine Roberts, who had been half angry
with the man ever since he had heard the strange
story&mdash;though he admitted all the time to his
secret soul that Erskine Burnham had been in
no wise to blame, went over loyally and royally
to his side, and said to Ruth while his honest
eyes filmed with something like tears and his
voice was husky:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aunt Ruth, it must be a grand thing for a
mother to have a son like that man across the
hall. If I can be half like him in true nobility,
my mother will have reason to be proud.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he even admitted to Maybelle that,
since he could not have her to himself yet
awhile, he was glad that that man who was
worthy that she should call him father was to
have the comfort of her.</p>

<p class="indent">It was noticeable to themselves that they said
very little about the mother. Poor mother!
she had forfeited her right to be talked of in the
tender and reverent way that Maybelle would
have talked, or with the passion of longing for
something had, and lost, that used to mark her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg&nbsp;389]</span>
words to Ruth. She said that word &quot;mamma&quot;
no more; the tone in which she used to speak
it had been peculiar, and had marked it as set
apart for a special and sacred use. Evidently it
meant more to her than the word &quot;mother,&quot;
or at least meant something different. Now,
in speaking to Ruth, she said always: &quot;My
mother,&quot; and said it in a hesitating, half-deprecating
tone, almost as if she must apologize
for her.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not that the girl was bitter; on the
contrary she was markedly tender of her
mother&#39;s memory and pitiful toward her.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth, with the reflex influence of this upon
her, found herself searching for all the lovable
qualities in Irene that she could by any possibility
recall, and by degrees it appeared that
death was having its inevitable and gracious
influence over hearts, softening the past and
casting a halo of excusing pity over that which
had at the time seemed unpardonable. But
her daughter never again said in a passion of
exquisite tenderness: &quot;My mamma!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had learned to say &quot;father,&quot; and used
the word with a shy grace that was fascinating;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[pg&nbsp;390]</span>
she had learned also what was of far more
consequence: to have the utmost respect for
and faith in the man to whom she gave the title.
Respect deepened steadily into love, and he became
indeed &quot;father&quot; to her, in her very thought.
Yet she never put into the word the throbbing
love that had shone in the words &quot;My papa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were a peaceful household, with a fair
and steadily increasing measure of happiness.
&quot;Baby Erskine,&quot; as they still called him and
probably would, his father said, until he was
ready for college, lived his beautiful, carefully
ordered life, blossoming into all the graces and
sweetnesses of judiciously trained and sheltered
childhood, and being familiarized with all the
sweet interests and excitements that belong to a
baby beloved. His first tooth, his first step,
his first definite word were as eagerly watched
for and as joyously heralded as though a fond
mother had been there to lead. Never had child
a more devoted sister and admirer and willing
slave than Maybelle; and no words ever expressed
more exultant pride and joy than those
in which she introduced him to transient
guests: &quot;My little brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[pg&nbsp;391]</span>
She labored patiently by the hour to teach the
boy to shout &quot;Papa!&quot; as soon as he caught a
glimpse from the window of the man who would
presently ride him upstairs on his proud shoulder;
but they never tried to train the baby lips to
say &quot;mamma.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad,&quot; said Maybelle one day, breaking
suddenly into speech in a way she had, over
a train of thought, the steps by which she had
reached it being kept to herself: &quot;I am glad
that he will always have the dearest and wisest
of grandmothers close at hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By inference,&quot; she said, &quot;I am led to believe
that you are speaking of Baby Erskine and his
grandmother, and am duly grateful for the compliment,
but the last remark you made was
about the climbing roses on the south porch.
Am I to be told or simply be left to imagine the
steps by which you reached from rosebuds to
Baby Erskine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maybelle laughed softly. &quot;The transition
was not so very great, dear doting grandmother!
Confess that you think so.&quot; Then, the color
deepening a little in her face, she added:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[pg&nbsp;392]</span>
&quot;I was thinking, dear, of our home here, and
of the coming changes, and of other&mdash;possibilities.
To be entirely frank, I thought of a possible
second mother for Baby Erskine. Father
is still so young that one cannot help thinking
sometimes of possibilities. And then, even
though I want you so much, I could not help
being glad that in any such event you would be
close to Baby Erskine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth held from outward notice any hint
of the sudden stricture at her heart over these
quiet words, and said cheerfully:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The near at hand probabilities are crowding
us so hard just now, darling, that I don&#39;t think
we have room for remote possibilities; let us
leave the unknown future, dear child, to One
who knows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was true that the coming changes were
almost beginning to crowd upon them. The
climbing rose bushes over the south porch were
even thus early thinking of budding; which
meant that June and Flossy Roberts and her
family would be with them in two months
more.</p>

<p class="indent">Time had flown on swift wing after all. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[pg&nbsp;393]</span>
hardly seemed possible that the young man,
who had seemed to begin his theological studies
but yesterday, was already receiving letters
addressed to &quot;The Reverend Erskine Shipley
Roberts!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One shadow Maybelle had, and Ruth understood
it well, although it was rarely mentioned
between them. Erskine Burnham, the very
soul of unselfish thoughtfulness for others, had
yet held with unaccountable tenacity to one
strange feeling. He shrank with evident pain
from the thought of Mamie Parker&#39;s presence in
the house. She had returned from China
early in the previous year, and Maybelle&#39;s first
eager hope that &quot;Aunt Mamie would come to
them at once&quot; for a stay of indefinite length
had been wonderingly put aside upon the discovery
that &quot;father&quot; apparently shrank from
even the mention of her name.</p>

<p class="indent">He made a painful effort to explain to his
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, mamma, I do not mean for one
moment to stand in the way of anything that
you and Maybelle really want, and I do not
know that I can explain to you why I feel as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg&nbsp;394]</span>
I do; but&mdash;she is associated, painfully associated,
as you know, with that which is like the bitterness
of death to me. And I cannot&mdash;We will
not talk about it, mamma.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth understood and was sorry for the
morbid strain which it revealed. She made
earnest effort to combat it, not vigorously but with
suggestive sentences as occasion offered. It
hurt her that Erskine should allow so comparatively
small a matter to retard his progress.
He had not only gone bravely through his peculiar
trial, but had made a distinct advance in
his spiritual life. Maybelle&#39;s constant prayer
for him had assuredly been answered. The
Lord Christ had, manifestly, a stronger grip on
his personality than ever before. All the details
of business and literary life were learning
from day to day that they were not to be masters
but servants to this man, and that One was his
Master.</p>

<p class="indent">But this sore spot which could not be touched
without pain, his mother felt sure would continue
to burn as long as he hid it away. If he
could know Mamie Parker as she now was, it
was almost certain that the sting of pain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg&nbsp;395]</span>
shame which her name suggested would lose its
power.</p>

<p class="indent">But Maybelle felt sure that Aunt Mamie
would never come unless invited by the host.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I can&#39;t want her to, grandmother,
much as I long to see her, so long as her presence
is not quite comfortable to father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the grandmother bided her time, and spoke
her occasional earnest words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In short, mamma,&quot; Erskine said one morning,
turning from the window where he had been
standing a silent listener to what she had to
say, &quot;In short, mamma, you are ashamed of
your son, are you not? And I don&#39;t wonder;
he is rather ashamed of himself. You have been
very patient, you and Maybelle, but this whole
thing must cease. Of course the child must
have her friend with her. Invite her, mamma,
in my name, to come at once and remain through
the season. I want it to be so. I do, indeed,
now that I have settled it; make Maybelle
understand that I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After he had left the room he turned back
to say pointedly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, mamma, it will not be necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[pg&nbsp;396]</span>
for me to see very much of her; but I shall try
to do my duty as host.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She saw how hard it was for him, but she rejoiced
with all her heart at this triumph over the
morbid strain.</p>

<p class="indent">And Mamie Parker came; and was met in
due form by her host and treated in every respect
as became an honored guest.</p>

<p class="indent">There came an evening when Ruth sat alone
by the open window of her room. She had
turned out the lights, for the room was flooded
with moonlight. It outlined distinctly the
little white bed in an alcove opening from her
room, where her darling lay sleeping. She had
just been in to look at him, and had resisted the
temptation to kiss once more the fair cheeks
flushed with healthy sleep. Downstairs in the
little reception room she knew that Maybelle
and Erskine Roberts were saying a few last
words together; the girl and the boy who,
to-morrow, would begin together the mystery
of manhood and womanhood, &quot;until death did
them part.&quot; From time to time she could hear
Maybelle&#39;s soft laughter float out on the quiet
air; they were very happy together, those two.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg&nbsp;397]</span>
From one of the guest chambers near at hand
the murmur of voices came to her occasionally.
It was growing late, and most of the guests had
retired early to make ready by rest for the excitements
of the morrow; but sleep had evidently
not come yet to Flossy and her husband.
They were talking softly. They were happy
together, those two. Downstairs on the long
vine-covered south porch two people were walking;
the murmur of their voices as they walked
and talked came up to her, Mamie Parker&#39;s
voice, and Erskine&#39;s. And the mother knew,
almost as well as though she could hear the
words, some of the things they were saying to
each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mommie,&quot; her son had said but a little
while before as he bent over and kissed his boy,
and then turned and put both arms about her
and kissed her, using the old name that of late
had almost dropped away from him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mommie, can you give me your blessing
and wish me Godspeed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had not pretended to misunderstand him.
She had known for days, it almost seemed to her
that she had known before he did, the trend that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[pg&nbsp;398]</span>
his life was taking. There had been no word
between them, but Erskine had told her once,
that he believed she knew his thoughts almost
as soon as they were born, and he seemed to
take her knowledge for granted.</p>

<p class="indent">She was glad that she had controlled her
voice, and that her answer had been quick and
free:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed, my son; God bless and prosper
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew he would be prospered. At least
a woman knows a woman&#39;s heart. They would
be happy together, they two.</p>

<p class="indent">Two, and two, and two, everywhere! the
youth and maiden, the mature man and woman,
the father and mother who were smiling together
over their son&#39;s espousals, always &quot;they two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It had been &quot;they two&quot; once with her. And
again, and for many years, mother and son;
but now&mdash;It seemed for a moment to the
lonely woman as though the whole world beside
was paired and wedded and only herself left
desolate. She pressed her hands firmly against
the balls of her closed eyes. Should she let one
tear mar this night of her son&#39;s new joy?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg&nbsp;399]</span>
And then, tenderly, like drops of balm upon
an aching wound, came the echo in her soul of
an old, <i>old</i> pledge: &quot;With everlasting loving-kindness
will I have mercy on thee, said the
Lord, thy Redeemer... I will betroth thee
unto me in faithfulness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a happy woman,&quot; she said aloud, in a
quiet voice; &quot;I am blessed in my home, and in
my&mdash;children, and in the abiding presence of
my Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>12mo, cloth, $1.00.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The author of &#39;Hold up your Heads, Girls!&#39; has, in the treatment of a
very important subject, invested it with an interest and brightness which will
make it pleasant and even fascinating reading for the class of young people
to whom it is addressed. In the eleven chapters of which the contents consist
there is more sound practical advice, sensibly put, on points of every-day
interest to girls, than we have ever before seen put into the same number of
pages. It is a book for study, for companionship, and the girl who reads it
thoughtfully and with an intent to profit by it will get more real help and
good from it than from a term at the best boarding-school in the country.&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston

<p class="indent"><i>12mo, illustrated, $1.25.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The college life of young women is described in this book in a very entertaining
way, and in a spirit the most wholesome and cheerful. Margaret
Regis is a splendid creation of the author&#39;s fancy, just such a young woman as
all of us like to read about. In her schooldays she is not different from
others. There is a shade of profound thought in her description of this
period of life: &#39;She is like the many, many girls, increasing in numbers
every year, who, unfixed and restless, go into college or the office, with a
vague determination to do something that shall make them independent or
superior to the greatest number of girls, but with no definite idea of how
they are to use the knowledge and experience they gain.&#39; Margaret Regis
does not remain long in this unsettled state. She is emphatically a woman
with a purpose. How its current was turned from the intended course makes
an interesting narrative which the reader will find full of profit.&quot;&mdash;<i>Cleveland

apple-tree, and revel in it all over again, taste it all just as the child tastes,
and find it luscious! For this book has charm and piquancy. And it is in
just this vivid remembrance of a child&#39;s mental workings, in just the avoidance
of all &#39;writing down&#39; to the supposed level of a child&#39;s mind, that
this story has its rare attractiveness. It is bright, winsome, and magnetic.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">This is a book for young people of either sex,
for, although the leading character is a girl of
eighteen, her cousins, two boys of sixteen and
fourteen respectively, are prominent throughout
the story, which centres about a beautiful girl,
left an orphan, as is supposed, in Barbados, who
goes to live with her uncle, a leading man in the
flourishing &quot;Goose Creek&quot; colony, in the year
of the Indian uprising, 1714. The very real danger
from the red men, who have been regarded
as friendly, but have been the victims of selfishness,
and thus made ready tools for the crafty
Spanish having their headquarters at St. Augustine,
forms the background to the story, and
gives opportunity for the surprising developments
which occur respecting the heroine and others. The illustrations
by Mr. Picknell are very accurate in their composition, besides being
finely executed.</p>

<div class="fig-right">

</div>

<p class="indent">A bright, helpful story of a girl who, as the
valedictorian and &quot;honor girl&quot; of her class at
high school, wins a scholarship which would
take her through Wellesley College. Family
reverses bring it home to her that <i>duty</i> demands
that she devote herself to helping her parents
and wayward brother to face the future better
than they seem likely to. She heroically surrenders
her prize, with its glowing prospects, to
a jealous rival, and with a brave humor says
that she has matriculated in the College of Life,
the hard features of which she happily styles the
&quot;faculty,&quot; with &quot;Professor Poverty&quot; prominent
among them. These prove excellent teachers,
aided by &quot;Professor Cheerfulness.&quot; Kind friends
are won by her courage, her brother achieves manly character, and the
family are finally re-established on the road to prosperity: all better,
happier, and more to each other than had selfishness not been so well
met and overcome by &quot;An Honor Girl.&quot;</p>

scene is laid in the fifties. There are thrilling
incidents, and also mysteries and suspicions,

<p>IN &quot;Pauline Wyman&quot; the author has drawn a typical New England
girl whose strong and beautiful character is developed by her environment.
How she overcomes unfavorable surroundings, her experience in
teaching school, the interesting circumstances in a young girl&#39;s life are
all told with the same originality and freshness which have drawn a multitude
of young people to the author&#39;s previous work.</p>

<p class="title">MADGE A GIRL IN EARNEST</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">S. Jennie Smith</span> 12mo Cloth Illustrated by <span class="smcap">James E. McBurney</span>
$1.25</p>

<p>MADGE is indeed &quot;a girl in earnest.&quot; She scorns the patronage of
an aristocratic relative and takes upon her strong young shoulders
the problem of carrying along the family in an independent manner.
Her bravely won success, in spite of the lions in her path, not the least
of which was the fear of social disfavor felt by some of her family, forms
an inspiring tale. An unusual amount of practical information is presented
in a thoroughly entertaining manner, and the character-drawing
is remarkably true and strong.</p>

<p class="title">We Four Girls</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Mary G. Darling</span> 12mo Cloth Illustrated
by <span class="smcap">Bertha G. Davidson</span>
$1.25</p>

<p>&quot;WE FOUR GIRLS&quot; is a bright story
of a summer vacation in the country,
where these girls were sent for study
and recreation. The story has plenty of
natural incidents; and a mild romance, in
which they are all interested, and of which
their teacher is the principal person, gives
interest to the tale. They thought it the
most delightful summer they ever passed.</p>

<p class="title">A Girl of this Century</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Mary G. Darling</span> Cloth Illustrated
by <span class="smcap">Lilian Crawford True</span> $1.25</p>

<p>THE same characters that appear in
&quot;We Four Girls&quot; are retained in
this story, the interest centering around
&quot;Marjorie,&quot; the natural leader of the four.
She has a brilliant course at Radcliffe, and
then comes the world. A romance, long
resisted, but worthy in nature and of happy
termination, crowns this singularly well-drawn
life of the noblest of all princesses&mdash;a
true American girl.</p>

<p class="title">Beck&#39;s Fortune A Story of School and Seminary Life</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Adele E. Thompson</span> Cloth Illustrated $1.25</p>

<p>THE characters in this book seem to live, their remarks are bright and
natural, and the incidental humor delightful. The account of Beck&#39;s
narrow and cheerless early life, her sprightly independence, and unexpected
competency that aids her to progress through the medium of seminary life
to noble womanhood, is one that mothers can commend to their daughters
unreservedly.</p>
